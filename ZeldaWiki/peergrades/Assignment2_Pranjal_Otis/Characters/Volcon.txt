==Biography==
Volcon is a [[Goron]] who stands outside of the [[Rollin' Inn]] in [[Goron City]], where he directs travelers to the lodge.<ref>{{Cite|A traveler! Perfect! Hey, why don'tcha stay here and rest your weary head?|Volcon|BotW}}</ref> Volcon helps run the Inn alongside [[Tray]],<ref>{{Cite|Stay at my inn, friend!|Volcon|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|HEY! We've got a customer comin' through!|Volcon|BotW}}</ref> and gives Goron-style massages to its customers.<ref>{{Cite|But to make up for that, I can offer you a mostly pain-free massage session.

After the [[Magma Bomb]]s stop falling following the {{Term|BotW|Divine Beast Vah Rudania|link}}'s liberation, Volcon becomes hopeful that droves of tourists will start coming to Goron City and stay at the Inn.<ref>{{Cite|A traveler! Perfect! Hey, did ya notice that the {{Color|BotW Blue|magma bombs}} have stopped fallin' from the sky? And that means... Well, hordes of tourists should start rollin' in soon, which means business is set to explode! I'll be busy as a rollin' stone in no time! If you're itchin' for a massage without a reservation... now's your last chance! So how about it? Why don'tcha stay here and rest your weary head?|Volcon|BotW}}</ref>
