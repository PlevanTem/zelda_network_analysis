==Biography==
Rhodes is a man who tends to the windmills with his loving wife, Ralera.<ref>{{Cite|[What are you up to?] I’m watching the windmills. They have to maintain a steady speed or the consistency of the flour will be off.|Rhodes|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|What are you up to?] What’s it look like? I’m keeping watch over the windmills. My devoted wife and I stand guard day and night.|Rhodes|BotW}}</ref> They take shifts with Rhodes being awake at night, while his wife takes over during the day.<ref>{{Cite|She’s not here right now, I mean. It’s more of a...time-sharing sort of thing. My love for her is so powerful that she suggested we take shifts. That way it feels more special when we’re together!|Rhodes|BotW}}</ref>

He is a friendly man who will speak to {{Term|BotW|Link|link}} if he wishes. Link can ask him about what he is doing, and Rhodes will describe his job for him. In response, Rhodes will return the question.<ref>{{Cite|Funny, that was going to be my question to you! What are you doing skulking around in the dead of night?|Rhodes|BotW}}</ref> Link can reply a few different ways: saying he is lost, that he is a thief, or that he is a traveler. Should he say that he is lost, Rhodes will laugh and say that everyone is lost to some extent. <ref>{{Cite|[I’m lost.] Hahaha, really? Well, they say everyone is lost in the woods of life. Or words to that effect.|Rhodes|BotW}}</ref> However, he then points him to the {{Term|BotW|Ton Pu Inn|link}} so Link can have somewhere to stay the night.<ref>{{Cite|The {{Color|BotW Blue|inn}} is down the hill, past the bridge. They’ve got soft beds and reasonable rates there if you want a night’s sleep.|Rhodes|BotW}}</ref> Rhodes will refer to him as the "lost boy" afterward.<ref>{{Cite|Well hello there, lost boy.|Rhodes|BotW}}</ref> If Link says he is a thief, Rhodes takes it as a game.<ref>{{Cite|[I’m a thief.] Haha, you want to play guards and bandits? Sure, OK. “You’re under arrest!” Satisfied?|Rhodes|BotW}}</ref> He will tease Link about it when spoken to again.<ref>{{Cite|Uh-oh, it’s the robber man! Hide your jewels and heirlooms!|Rhodes|BotW}}</ref> When Link admits that he is a traveler, Rhodes is fairly uninterested as he does not consider the hero a threat.<ref>{{Cite|[I’m a traveler.] Are you, now. Well, that’s fine. You seem harmless enough.|Rhodes|BotW}}</ref>

At 9 o'clock in the evening, he heads out to the tree for his round of watching the windmills.<ref>{{Cite|Hello and good evening. It’s about time I started work...|Rhodes|BotW}}</ref> Once 5 o'clock in the morning rolls around, Rhodes goes home to rest.<ref>{{Cite|Hey there. It’s bedtime for me. I spend nights working, so I have to get my sleep in where I can.|Rhodes|BotW}}</ref>
