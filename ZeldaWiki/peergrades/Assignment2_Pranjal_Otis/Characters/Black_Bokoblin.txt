{{Term/Store|Black Bokoblin|Black Bokoblins|Series, BotW, CoH}} are enemies in the {{TLoZ|Series}}.<ref>{{Cite|'''{{Color|BotW Shrine Quest|Black Bokoblin}}'''|Hyrule Compendium|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Defeated By: Black Bokoblin|Game Over|CoH}}</ref>{{Name Ref|StBotW, HWAoC}}

==Characteristics==
==={{BotW|-}}===
{{Compendium/Extract|Black Bokoblin}}
{{Plural|BotW|Black Bokoblin}} are a stronger variant of {{Plural|BotW|Blue Bokoblin|link}}. They are much more resilient and are usually armed with stronger {{Plural|BotW|Weapon}} than their common counterparts, including {{Plural|BotW|Dragonbone Boko Club|link}} and {{Plural|BotW|Dragonbone Boko Bat|link}}. {{Plural|BotW|Black Bokoblin}} may be found in monster camps and occasionally on roads where they may attack passing travelers. {{Plural|BotW|Black Bokoblin}} may also sometimes be found going on hunts while riding {{Plural|BotW|Horse|link}}.

Black Bokoblins share an attack pattern with other {{Term|BotW|Bokoblin}} counterparts. On the ground, {{Plural|BotW|Black Bokoblin}} mainly attack by swinging and slamming their held {{Plural|BotW|Weapon}}. In the event that their {{Plural|BotW|Weapon}} is lost or stolen, they will search for any other available {{Plural|BotW|Weapon}} nearby and use them instead. In some monster camps, {{Plural|BotW|Black Bokoblin}} may also be found standing on top watch towers, where they may alert other monsters to {{Term|BotW|Link}}'s presence by blowing a horn. These {{Plural|BotW|Black Bokoblin}} may also be equipped with {{Plural|BotW|Bow|link}} that they use to snipe intruders with {{Plural|BotW|Arrow|link}}.

When defeated, {{Plural|BotW|Black Bokoblin}} may drop {{Plural|BotW|Bokoblin Fang|link}}, {{Plural|BotW|Bokoblin Horn|link}}, or {{Term|BotW|Bokoblin Guts|link}}.

==={{StBotW|-}}===

They're stronger than the {{Term|CoH|Green Bokoblin|link}} and {{Term|CoH|Red Bokoblin|link}}, but share the same beat pattern as they raise their arms up for one beat before moving on the following beat.
{{Ambig|End}}

{{Stub|HWAoC}}
