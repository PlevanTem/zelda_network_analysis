==Biography==
{{Term|BotW|Trello}} is the father of {{Term|BotW|Rivan|link}} and the grandfather of {{Term|BotW|Dunma|link}}. Like many elderly {{Term|BotW|Zora|link}}, {{Term|BotW|Trello}} holds resentment towards any {{Plural|BotW|Hylian|link}}, including {{Term|BotW|Link|link}}, for [[Mipha]]'s death.<ref>{{Cite|How dare you show your face here! After what you did to Lady Mipha!|Trello|BotW}}</ref> He refrains from attacking Link due to having his hands full trying to figure out what to do about [[Divine Beast Vah Ruta]].<ref>{{Cite|But I'm afraid those of us in the Zora council have our hands full trying to figure out what to do next about {{Color|BotW Blue|Ruta}}.|Trello|BotW}}</ref>

Once Vah Ruta has been calmed, Trello will respect Link instead of shaming him. <ref>{{Cite|I knew you were the same Link from 100 years ago... You did a fine job this time.|Trello|BotW}}</ref> Since retiring, {{Term|BotW|Trello}} is in charge of the Champion Festival and bears the {{Term|BotW|Ceremonial Trident|link}}<ref>{{Cite|Since retiring, he has been in charge of the Champion Festival. It is he who now bears the Ceremonial Trident|Rivan|BotW}}</ref>. As part of the Shrine Quest "[[The Ceremonial Song]]", Trello can be approached by Link about the [[Ceremonial Trident]]. He reveals that the trident used in the [[Champion Festival]] is a replica of Mipha's [[Lightscale Trident]].<ref>{{Cite|The Champion Festival's {{Color|BotW Blue|Lightscale Trident}}... Well, it's a fake.|Trello|BotW}}</ref> He admits that he dropped the trident off the bridge while taking it for [[Dento]] to examine.<ref>{{Cite|I planned to have that {{Color|BotW Red|ceremonial trident}} examing by Dento, but on the way there, I dropped it off the bridge.|Trello|BotW}}</ref> However, he doesn't care much for it since it's fake, and decides to ask Dento to make a new one.<ref>{{Cite|It doesn't really matter. It's a fake, after all... I'll have to ask Dento to make a new one.|Trello|BotW}}</ref>
