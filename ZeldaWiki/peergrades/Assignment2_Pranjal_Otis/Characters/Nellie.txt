==Biography==
Nellie is an elderly [[Gerudo]] who can be found in [[Gerudo Town]]. If [[Link]] speaks to her during the day, she finds it interesting to see a "Hylian vai" and tells Link that she is going to bed soon to avoid the hot weather.<ref>{{Cite|A Hylian vai, huh... Sav'aaq...|Nellie|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|It's gonna get hot soon, so I think I'm going to head to bed.|Nellie|BotW}}</ref> If Link speaks to Nellie while she is sleeping in her home, she irritably asks what he wants and says that she prefers to sleep during the day.<ref>{{Cite|Ugh, what is it? I prefer to rest and relax until night...|Nellie|BotW}}</ref> If Link speaks to Nellie after she has woken up later in the day, she questions to Link how people tolerate the heat of the afternoon and then decides to go get a drink.<ref>{{Cite|The nighttime is really nice. I can't believe how much people move around in the heat of the afternoon.|Nellie|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|I guess I could get a drink to wake myself up...|Nellie|BotW}}</ref> During the night, Nellie can be found drinking in [[The Noble Canteen]]. If Link speaks to her, she comments that the drink is the only thing that can "wake her up."<ref>{{Cite|Phew! This is really the only thing that can wake me up.|Nellie|BotW}}</ref>

In the very early hours of the morning, she can be found outside [[Lorn]]'s stall, observing the fruits for sale. Nellie claims her vaba told her myriad times to never drink and eat [[Hearty Durian]]s. Nellie knows there is a good reason, but is unsure of what that reason is.<ref>{{Cite|My vaba often said to never eat a hearty durian while drinking... I don't really know why, but since she said it so much, there must be a good reason.|Nellie|BotW}}</ref>A few hours later, she'll depart to visit [[Ardin]]. If Link speaks to Nellie while she is standing at Ardin's General Store, which sells a variety of mushrooms, she says her mother taught her that meals containing mushrooms help relieve strong headaches.<ref>{{Cite|My mom often said that dishes with mushrooms were good for nursing serious headaches.|Nellie|BotW}}</ref> For that reason, Nellie always makes [[Fragrant Mushroom Sauté]] for herself when she is tired.<ref>{{Cite|So...when I'm feeling tired, I always make {{Color|BotW Blue|fragrant mushroom sauté}}. I love that curry flavor!|Nellie|BotW}}</ref> Nellie then explains how to make the dish by cooking [[Goron Spice]] with any mushroom.<ref>{{Cite|It's a simple dish that you can make if you have some {{Color|BotW Blue|Goron spice}} and {{Color|BotW Blue|mushrooms}}.|Nellie|BotW}}</ref>
