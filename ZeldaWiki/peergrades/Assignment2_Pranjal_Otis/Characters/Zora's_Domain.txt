It is based on [[Zora's Waterfall]] from {{ALttP}}. It serves as the home of the aquatic race known as the [[Zora]].

==Features and Overview==
[[File:Zora's Domain OoT3D.jpg|thumb|left|195px|Zora's Domain from {{OoT3D|-}}]]
==={{OoT|-}}===
In {{OoT}}, Zora's Domain is located in the northeast section of [[Hyrule]] and is home to [[King Zora]] and his daughter, [[Princess Ruto]].<ref>{{Cite|The Zoras come from Zora's Domain in northeast Hyrule.|Kaepora Gaebora|OoT}}</ref> It consists of a large cavernous area mostly filled with water, with a large waterfall flowing from the top into the lower area. Its source of water comes from [[Zora's Fountain]], to which it is closely linked. The only ways to access the domain are from [[Zora's River]] or via a secret entrance hidden underwater in [[Lake Hylia]]; however, only those who have some connection with the [[Royal Family of Hyrule]] are allowed to enter.<ref>{{Cite|Just ahead lies Zora's Domain. The Zoras serve Hyrule's Royal Family by protecting this water source. Their door will not open for anyone except those who have some connection with the Royal Family.|Kaepora Gaebora|OoT}}</ref> To enter via Zora's River, [[Link]] will need to play "[[Zelda's Lullaby]]" in front of the seemingly impassable waterfall at the end of the river to prove his connection to the Royal Family. This will cause the waterfall to momentarily split in two, allowing the young hero to access Zora's Domain.

Link's first visit to the domain is called upon during his search for the third Spiritual Stone, the [[Zora's Sapphire]]. He ventures [[Inside Jabu-Jabu's Belly]] in Zora's Fountain to rescue Princess Ruto, receiving the Spiritual Stone in return. Seven years later, after Link awakens from having pulled the [[Master Sword]] from its [[Pedestal of Time|pedestal]], the young hero returns to Zora's Domain to find it completely frozen over. Moreover, the entrance to Lake Hylia has been blocked by ice. The only Zoras that inhabit it are King Zora and the shopkeeper of the [[Zora Shop]], and both of them are frozen over by [[Red Ice]], which only [[Blue Fire]] can melt.<ref>{{Cite|I'm sure you've already seen it! Zora's Domain--totally frozen! A young man named Sheik saved me from under the ice... But my father and the other Zoras have not...yet...|Princess Ruto|OoT}}</ref> [[Sheik]] explains that the ice is caused by an evil curse, and the source of the curse is [[Morpha]], a monster in the {{Term|OoT3D|Water Temple|link}}. The only way to restore Zora's Domain to its natural state is by destroying Morpha. Thus, Link ventures to the Water Temple where, with the aid of Princess Ruto, the source of the curse is shut off.<ref>{{Cite|This ice is created by an evil curse... The monster in the Water Temple is the source of the curse. Unless you shut off the source, this ice will never melt... If you have courage enough to confront the danger and save the Zoras, I will teach you the melody that leads to the temple.|Sheik|OoT}}</ref> Princess Ruto, awakening as the [[Sage of Water]], thanks to Link for his help and reassures him that Zora's Domain and its people will eventually return to their original state.<ref>{{Cite|Zora's Domain and its people will eventually return to their original state.|Princess Ruto|OoT}}</ref>

During the ending credits, Zora's Domain is shown to have been thawed out, although it is still empty since all of the Zoras are in [[Lon Lon Ranch]] celebrating the defeat of [[Ganon|Ganondorf]].

=== {{TP|-}} ===
[[File:Frozen Zora.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Frozen Zoras in Zora's Domain]]
In {{TP}}, Zora's Domain is located in the [[Lanayru Province]], and it serves as [[Hyrule]]'s source of water. The water flow comes from the throne room, situated above the domain. From here, the water streams into the rest of the village, forming the Zora's Waterfall and continuing its path to [[Upper Zora's River]] and eventually reaching [[Lake Hylia]]. Zora's Domain is also connected to [[Snowpeak]], and it is the only way to access that region other than [[Warping]]. Link can access the throne room by asking one of the Zoras near the waterfall to take him upstream.<ref>{{Cite|So, what do you think? Is it not a splendid waterfall? This one is the largest in our domain. And this waterfall flows directly from the throne room. If you would like, I can take you there.|Zora|TP}}</ref>

When Link first visits Zora's Domain, he finds that it has been completely frozen over and all the Zoras have been trapped under the thick sheet of ice. Since the domain is frozen, Zora's River has dried up as well as Lake Hylia.<ref>{{Cite|We've had absolutely no water flowing from upstream... There's no mistaking it. Something must have happened at the water's source in our home, Zora's Domain.|Zora|TP}}</ref> Link must warp a [[Molten Shard]] from [[Death Mountain]] with the help of [[Midna]] and drop it into the throne room, which will cause the ice to shatter and allow the water to flow again. With Zora's Domain now thawed and the Zoras safe, Wolf Link and Midna begin to head out of the throne room when [[Rutela]] makes an apparition before them, stopping them on their way out. She thanks them for saving her village and her people,<ref>{{Cite|Wait! Please, you must allow me to thank you for revitalizing both my people and this spring, which is the water source for all the lands of Hyrule.|Rutela|TP}}</ref> and informs them of her unfortunate fate.<ref>{{Cite|The dark ones... They raided this village and, as a message to my people, executed me before them. When the dark ones descended upon our village, I sent my young one, Ralis, to Hyrule Castle to inform Princess Zelda of our fate. But... I fear danger followed him from this doomed place. I feel it. His presence grows fainter to me over time...|Rutela|TP}}</ref> Rutela asks Link to save her son [[Ralis]] and promises to give him the [[Zora Armor]] in return, which is necessary to enter the [[Lakebed Temple]].<ref>{{Cite|Please... Would you save my dearest, Prince Ralis? If you do this thing, I will bestow upon you the protection of water. This power will grant you the ability to swim and respire in very deep water as if you were a Zora.|Rutela|TP}}</ref>

Later on in the game, after Link obtains the [[Coral Earring]] from Prince Ralis, the young hero must revisit Zora's Domain to [[fishing|fish]] in an area known as the [[Mother-and-Child Rocks]].<ref>{{Cite|The reekfish can be found near the Mother-and-Child Rocks in the waterfall basin near my village.|Prince Ralis|TP}}</ref> It is here that the [[Reekfish]] dwell, a rare fish specimen unique to the Zora village.<ref>{{Cite|It must be a reekfish. That is a rare specimen found only in the Zora village.|Prince Ralis|TP}}</ref> Once Link manages to catch a Reekfish, he will be able to pick up the [[Scent|Reekfish Scent]] that is necessary to navigate through Snowpeak.

[[File:ALBW Zora's Domain.png|200px|right|thumb|Zora's Domain from {{ALBW|-}}]]

After Link obtains the [[Water Bomb]]s and Zora Armor, he can sink to the bottom of the throne room and blow up the remains of the Molten Shard, releasing a [[Goron]] that was trapped in it. By speaking to him, Link will receive a [[Bomb Bag]]. Eventually, Prince Ralis will return to Zora's Domain and sit in the throne room in place of his mother.

Zora's Domain is last seen during the ending credits, showing Queen Rutela looking over her son.

==={{ALBW|-}}===
Zora's Domain appears again in {{ALBW}} as the abode of Queen [[Oren]] and her [[Zora Underling|Underlings]]. When Link first visits Zora's Domain, he bumps into the [[Shady Guy]], who has stolen Oren's [[Smooth Gem]]. This causes discord among the Zoras, as Oren begins to uncontrollably bloat without the Smooth Gem. After Link returns the stolen Smooth Gem, Oren gives the young hero the [[Flippers#A Link Between Worlds|Zora's Flippers]] out of gratitude.

After Oren is trapped within a [[Painting]] and subsequently released, she vows to return to Zora's Domain once Link defeats [[Yuga]] and [[Ganon]].<ref>{{Cite|You have my undying gratitude, young hero. You are truly among the very best of your people. Now there is more for you to do, if I am to get back home to MY people. The Zoras are surely worried.|Oren|ALBW}}</ref>

==={{BotW|-}}===
{{Stub|BotW}}
In {{BotW}}, {{Term|BotW|Zora's Domain}} is located in the [[Lanayru (Region)|Lanayru Region]] and is the home of the {{Term|BotW|Zora}}. Travelers entering the area by foot cross the {{Term|BotW|Great Zora Bridge|link}} over {{Term|BotW|Ruto Lake}} and are greeted with a view of a large stone fish surmounting the Domain, which represents Lord Jabu-Jabu.<ref>{{Cite Book|quote= |book= CaC |publisher= |page= 274}}</ref> Unlike other towns in the game, Zora's Domain consists of a single extensive structure instead of separate buildings. Its design include a number of curving bridges and open spaces, which are often bounded by colonnades instead of walls. The Domain's structure includes large quantities of {{Term|BotW|Luminous Stone|link}}, which causes several portions of it to glow softly during the night. These structures are maintained by two Zora artisans, {{Term|BotW|Fronk|link}} and {{Term|BotW|Ledo|link}}, apprenticed under {{Term|BotW|Dento|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|Fronk and I are Master Dento's faithful apprentices.|Ledo|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Master always tells us, "Repairing the domain is part of your training." So that's what we're doing now.|Ledo|BotW}}</ref>  Upkeep of the Domain requires the use of large quantities of Luminous Stone.<ref>{{Cite|Repairs require a large number of {{Color|BotW Blue|luminous stones}}. You can find plenty of them around {{Color|BotW Blue|Upland Zorana}}. Have you, by chance, already stumbled across some {{Color|BotW Blue|luminous stones}} during your travels? For instance, if you have {{Color|BotW Red|10 of them}}, that would be a big help...|Ledo|BotW}}</ref>

The Great Zora Bridge opens into a plaza centered around a statue of {{Term|BotW|Mipha|link}}. The far side of the plaza is bounded by the central structure of the Domain. The central opening in the wall leads down a short flight of stairs to a pool containing {{Plural|BotW|Fleet-Lotus Seeds|link}} and {{Plural|BotW|Bright-Eyed Crab|link}}. The {{Term|BotW|Ne'ez Yohma Shrine|link}} is found in the center of this pool. To the sides of this opening are a shopping center, {{Term|BotW|Marot Mart|link}}, and the {{Term|BotW|Seabed Inn|link}}. A pair of stairways on the outer sides of these buildings lead to the Domain's second floor, above the stores and shrine, where a large roofed area contains several water-filled pools where the Zora sleep at night. Several {{Plural|BotW|Sneaky River Snail|link}} can also be found around these pools. Two further flights of stairs lead to the royal throne room on the third level.

The Domain is ruled by the family of {{Term|BotW|King Dorephan|link}} and his son {{Term|BotW|Sidon}}. Their princess, who was a sister to the prince and daughter to the king, was {{Term|BotW|Mipha}}, who was also a deceased Zora Champion of Hyrule, tasked to pilot the [[Divine Beast]] [[Divine Beast Vah Ruta|Vah Ruta]].

==={{LCT|-}}===
{{Term|LCT|Level 4|link}} of {{LCT}} is specifically seated in the outer waters of Zora's Domain. The stage begins facing a waterfall and has [[target]]s falling with the water at various speeds. A few [[pot]]s can be shot for additional points. In the second area, Link shoots at targets dropping with the waterfall and panning through openings in the mountainside. The stage normally ends in an overhead view of the two waterfalls as the targets again follow the water downwards. The alternative end can be unlocked by getting 1000 points on the [[Scarecrow#Link's Crossbow Training|Scarecrows]] from the first two sections. The stage ending scene will take Link above the waterfalls and offer a larger cluster of targets drifting towards him. Many more gold targets are found in this area among the regular and false targets.

=== ''Hyrule Warriors: Age of  Calamity'' ===
In Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, Zora's Domain is the residence of the [[Zora|Zoras]], King Dorephan, Sidon(who is still a child at the time), and Mipha. It is the place where [[Princess Zelda|Zelda]] asks King Dorephan to give permission to Mipha to pilot [[Divine Beast]] Vah Ruta. It is also the battlefield where the [[Scenario]], "[[Mipha, the Zora Princess]]" takes place.

==Trivia==
*According to an interview given by [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] to [[Nintendo Power]] for their 100th issue, an area called "Zola Lake" was planned to be included in {{OoT|-}}. This may have been during the phase of development where Zoras were still [[Zora (Enemy)|Enemies]], and was instead converted into the more village-like Zora's Domain.<ref>{{Cite Book|quote= Miyamoto also described several areas, mentioning mountains, valleys, a deep "fairy" forest, and the mythical Zola Lake|book= Nintendo Power Volume 100|publisher= Nintendo Power|page= 15}}</ref>
*Although Zora's Domain does not appear in {{TWW}}, [[Laruto]]'s [[Figurines in The Wind Waker|Figurine]] states that she was born there prior to the [[Great Flood]].<ref>{{Cite|Birthplace: Zora's Domain. Long, long ago the Zora sage, Laruto, offered up her prayers in the Earth Temple so that the Master Sword would continue to house the power to repel evil.|Figurine|TWW}}</ref>
