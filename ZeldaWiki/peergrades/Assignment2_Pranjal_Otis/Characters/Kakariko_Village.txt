==Features and Overview==
==={{ALttP|-}}===
In {{ALttP}}, {{Term|ALttP|Kakariko Village}} is the largest settlement. It is located in the western side of the {{Term|ALttP|Light World|link}}, just south of the {{Term|ALttP|Lost Woods|link}}. Here there are several {{Plural|ALttP|Merchant|link}}, as well as villagers with vital information for {{Term|ALttP|Link|link}}. {{Term|ALttP|Kakariko Village}} has a number of businesses, including {{Plural|ALttP|Dwarven Swordsmith|link}}, {{Plural|ALttP|Shop|link}}, a {{Term|ALttP|Fortune Teller|link}}, a tavern, and an inn.

{{Term|ALttP|Kakariko Village}} is the home of {{Term|ALttP|Sahasrahla|link}}, the famed elder, and his family, and it is with the intention to find him that {{Term|ALttP|Link}} first travels there.<ref>{{Cite|Meet the elder of the village and get the Master Sword.|Loyal Sage|ALttP}}</ref> Upon arriving in {{Term|ALttP|Kakariko Village}}, {{Term|ALttP|Link}} discovers that he has been blamed for the abduction of {{Term|ALttP|Princess Zelda|link}}, and that some villagers who believe him to be guilty will summon {{Plural|ALttP|Soldier (Enemy)|link}} to arrest him.<ref>{{Cite|WANTED!

After {{Term|ALttP|Link}} retrieves the {{Term|ALttP|Master Sword|link}} from the {{Term|ALttP|Lost Woods|link}}, {{Term|ALttP|Kakariko Village}} is overrun by {{Plural|ALttP|Soldier (Enemy)}} who will attack {{Term|ALttP|Link}} at sight, forcing the villagers to remain inside their homes. It is also at this point that {{Term|ALttP|Link}} can free the {{Term|ALttP|Flute Boy's Bird|link}} sealed within the {{Term|ALttP|Weathercock|link}} located in the middle of {{Term|ALttP|Kakariko Village}}. After {{Term|ALttP|Link}} receives the {{Term|ALttP|Flute|link}} from the {{Term|ALttP|Flute Boy|link}} in the {{Term|ALttP|Dark World|link}}, he can play the {{Term|ALttP|Instrument|link}} in front of the statue to reveal a small {{Term|ALttP|Bird|link}} within. With the {{Term|ALttP|Flute Boy's Bird}} awakened, {{Term|ALttP|Link}} can call it to be transported to specific places in the {{Term|ALttP|Light World}} any time the {{Term|ALttP|Flute}} is played.

{{Term|ALttP|Blind the Thief|link}}, the leader of a gang of thieves, once lived in {{Term|ALttP|Kakariko Village}}, where his home served as the hideout for his mischievous companions.<ref>{{Cite|Yo Link!

It is here that he finds {{Term|ALttP|Blind the Thief}}, who reveals himself to be the {{Term|ALttP|Boss|link}} of the {{Term|ALttP|Dark World}}'s fourth {{Term|ALttP|Dungeon|link}}: {{Term|ALttP|Thieves' Town (Dungeon)|link}}.

==={{OoT|-}}===
[[File:Kakarikovillageoot.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Kakariko Village in {{OoT|-}}]]
In {{OoT}}, Kakariko Village is located in the northeastern portion of Hyrule, right next to [[Hyrule Castle Town]] and at the foothills of [[Death Mountain]]. The town is an entrance to a number of locations, such as the [[Shadow Temple]], the [[Bottom of the Well]], the [[Kakariko Village Graveyard|Graveyard]], and the [[Death Mountain Trail]].

The village's origins are elaborated upon during the game, explaining that it was founded by the [[Sheikah]], the guardians of the [[Royal Family of Hyrule]].<ref name="Grave">{{Cite|R.I.P. / Here lie the souls of those who swore fealty to the Royal Family of Hyrule / The Sheikah, guardians of the Royal Family and founders of Kakariko, watch over these spirits in their eternal slumber.|Tombstone|OoT}}</ref> Moreover, it is revealed that the village was home to only those pertaining to the Sheikah tribe, although it was later opened up to the poor commoners by Impa, who was also born and raised in Kakariko.<ref>{{Cite|At the foot of Death Mountain you will find my village, Kakariko. That is where I was born and raised.|Impa|OoT}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|This village used to be a {{Typo|Shiekah|Sheikah}} village, but the great Impa opened it to everyone.|Soldier|OoT}}</ref> As such, she is often considered the leader of Kakariko Village, not only for having helped the commoners of Hyrule, but also for her great efforts in turning the village into a great city to equal the bustling metropolis of Hyrule Castle Town.<ref>{{Cite|Impa, the leader of Kakariko Village, had sealed the evil shadow spirit in the bottom of the well....|Sheik|OoT}}</ref><ref name= "Improve">{{Cite|I am the boss of the carpenters that Impa hired to improve this village and make it into a true city!|Master Craftsman|OoT}}</ref>

Kakariko Village as seen in {{OoT|-}} is one of the most prominent locations in the game due to it being Link's primary destination many times during his adventure through Hyrule. The town is home to many important attractions, such as the [[Kakariko Windmill|windmill]], which is used to draw water up from the well, the village's only source of water. It is also the location of the Kakariko Graveyard, where the souls of the fallen [[Hyrulean]]s, [[Royal Family of Hyrule|Hylian Royal Family]], and Sheikah tribe members are said to rest.<ref name="Grave"/> The small town also contains many buildings of interest, including a [[Medicine Shop|Potion Shop]], a [[Shooting Gallery]] (still under construction in the earlier time period), and a {{Term|OoT|Bazaar|link}}. Some notable residents include the [[Cucco Lady]], the [[Carpenters]], the [[Graveyard Boy]] and his family, and [[Dampé]]. Through various actions, Link will obtain numerous items from this village, including the [[Lens of Truth]], a [[Bottle]], a [[Hylian Shield]], and several [[Ocarina]] Songs, such as the [[Song of Storms]], [[Sun's Song]], and [[Nocturne of Shadow]]. The [[House of Skulltula]] is also here, where Link will be rewarded based on how many [[Gold Skulltula]] Tokens he has collected.

[[File:BurningKakariko.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Kakariko Village on fire after Bongo Bongo escapes]]

Link's first visit to Kakariko is called upon when Impa advises the young hero to go to her village to learn more about the Spiritual Stone of Fire, the [[Goron's Ruby]]. When Link first visits Kakariko as a child, he finds that most of the village is under construction due to Impa's goal of trying to improve the small town and turn it into a true city.<ref name= "Improve"/> Later on, Link learns the [[Song of Storms]] as an adult. After this song is acquired, Link must travel back in time and play the song inside the windmill in front of [[Guru-Guru]] to dry up the well, allowing him to explore the interior of the well and obtain the [[Lens of Truth]] in the process.

During the time that Link remains in his seven-year slumber due to him retrieving the [[Master Sword]] from its [[Pedestal of Time|pedestal]], [[Ganondorf]] launches an attack on Hyrule Castle Town, forcing its citizens to flee to Kakariko Village to escape from his wrath.<ref>{{Cite|Ever since he escaped from Hyrule Castle Town, he's become even more timid!|Hylian|OoT}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Since Ganondorf came, people in the Castle Town have gone, places have been ruined, and monsters are wandering everywhere.|Malon|OoT}}</ref> When Link returns to Kakariko after having awakened [[Princess Ruto]] as the [[Sage|Sage of Water]], he finds the village in flames. The young hero learns from [[Sheik]] that the evil shadow spirit, which had been sealed by Impa long ago, has escaped from the bottom of the well, wreaking havoc on the village and setting it on fire.<ref>{{Cite|A terrible thing has happened! The evil shadow spirit has been released! Impa, the leader of Kakariko Village, had sealed the evil shadow spirit in the bottom of the well... But the force of the evil spirit got so strong, the seal of the well broke, and it escaped into the world!!|Sheik|OoT}}</ref> 

The spirit easily defeats both Link and Sheik, and once the young hero regains consciousness, Sheik explains that Impa has gone to the [[Shadow Temple]] in an effort to seal the spirit again, revealing that Impa is one of the six Sages. Sheik urges Link to help Impa, teaching him the [[Nocturne of Shadow]]. This song is necessary to gain access to the upper part of the graveyard, which is the only entrance to the Shadow Temple where the "Phantom Shadow Beast" [[Bongo Bongo]] resides.<ref>{{Cite|I believe Impa has gone to the Shadow Temple to seal it up again, but...she will be in danger without any help! Link! Impa is one of the six Sages. Destroy the evil shadow spirit and save Impa! There is an entrance to the Shadow Temple beneath the graveyard behind this village. The only thing I can do for you is teach you the melody that will lead you to the Shadow Temple... This is the melody that will draw you into the infinite darkness that absorbs even time... Listen to this, the Nocturne of Shadow!!|Sheik|OoT}}</ref> The fire almost consumed the village, but after Link regains consciousness, it is revealed by the [[Blue Juggler]] that he and many other villagers working together stopped the flames. <ref>{{Cite|The fire almost consumed us all! But together, we all were able to put out the fire! Pretty good work, don't you think?|Blue Juggler|OoT}}</ref>

==={{FSA|-}}===
{{Main|Kakariko Village (Four Swords Adventures)}}
In {{FSA}}, Kakariko Village appears as the second stage of [[The Dark World]] level. The village is set in the middle of the darkness that is covering northwestern Hyrule known as the {{Term|FSA|Dark World|link}}, which as a result has warped its appearance into a cursed place in a state of anarchy.<ref>{{Cite|Do you know this village, Link? Kakariko was once home to many kind people. Now however, it's become a rather dangerous place. The darkness that cloaks its people has cost many of them their humanity. It's madness. How much stronger will this darkness in Hyrule grow?|Kaepora Gaebora|FSA}}</ref> The [[Links]] arrive at the village on their search for the [[Dark Mirror]], and find that the town is overrun with [[Thief|thieves]] and set ablaze by the [[Shadow Link]]s. The Links work to capture the thieves and douse the village's flames, before continuing on their search for the [[Temple of Darkness]]. In this appearance, Kakariko Village has no prominent features, and is a simple collection of houses with a few residents.

To the east of town is a downstream river that leads to the end of the stage, where the Links encounter and fight a [[Big Dark Stalfos]], and in doing so, rescue one of the four [[Knights of Hyrule]] and recover the Green Royal Jewel.

==={{TP|-}}===
[[File:KakarikoInTwilight.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Kakariko Village covered in Twilight in {{TP|-}}]]
In {{TP}}, Kakariko Village is located in the [[Eldin Province]], right below [[Death Mountain]] and just {{exp|GCN version; southwest in the Wii version|southeast}} of [[Hyrule Field]]. It has several homes, as well as a {{Term|TPHD|Bomb Shop|link}}, an [[Elde Inn|inn]], a [[sanctuary (Twilight Princess)|sanctuary]], a [[Eldin Spring|spring]], and a [[Hot Spring|hot spring]]. Moreover, a [[Kakariko Village Graveyard|graveyard]] can be found right behind the sanctuary, housing the tombstone of the [[King Zora]]. According to [[Rutela]], Kakariko Village is considered to be a "sacred place for the [[Zora]] people" since that is where they take their eternal rest.<ref>{{Cite|Kakariko Village is a sacred place for the Zora people. It is where we take our eternal rest.|Rutela|TP}}</ref> Many of the game's important plot events occur in this village and many items can be bought and found here, such as [[Bomb]]s, the [[Hawkeye]], a [[Hylian Shield]], and the [[Zora Armor]].

By the time the events of {{TP|-}} take place, most of the townsfolk have already been transformed into [[Shadow Beast]]s due to the [[Shadow Invasion]].<ref name= "Barnes">{{Cite|They sure didn't seem impressed by my bombs! How long do you think we can hold this sanctuary against beasts that strong, huh? Once they attack, it's OVER! Remember the lady from the general store? Just one of those things attacked her, and a whole gang from town went to save her! And what happened? She was already gone, and there were TWO monsters waitin'! ...You connectin' the dots? That means that if we get attacked by them, then we'll be...|Barnes|TP}}</ref> The only survivors left seem to be [[Renado]], {{Term|TPHD|Luda|link}}, and {{Term|TPHD|Barnes|link}}, and because of this, Kakariko seems to be a rather desolate place with many dilapidated buildings. When Link visits the village, he finds {{Term|TPHD|Beth|link}}, [[Colin]], [[Talo]] and [[Malo]] taking refuge inside Renado's sanctuary along with Barnes and Luda. It is here that Barnes recalls how a woman was attacked by a Shadow Beast and, although a group of villagers went to save her, she was already gone by the time they arrived.<ref name= "Barnes"/>

Once Link returns light to the Eldin Province, it is explained that Renado, who is actually the shaman of the village, took the [[Ordon Village|Ordon]] children in after the Shadow Beasts left them to die.<ref>{{Cite|The beasts took us and left us to die...but Mr. Renado found us.|N/A|TP}}</ref> It is then that the young hero is tasked with retrieving the second [[Fused Shadow]] from Death Mountain in order to cleanse the [[Goron|Gorons']] sacred grounds from evil.<ref>{{Cite|The dark power you seek lies in the sacred grounds of the proud mountain dwellers. But already those grounds have been defiled, draped in shadow and seeded with evil. You must go to those sacred grounds and cleanse them.|Eldin (Spirit)|TP}}</ref> However, after trying unsuccessfully to climb the mountain, he returns to Kakariko to find a wild [[Epona]] being controlled by [[Bulblin]]s. Link is quickly able to tame her, and he proceeds to ride her back to [[Ordon Village]] to ask [[Mayor Bo]] how to best the Gorons.

After obtaining the [[Iron Boots]] from Bo, Link returns to Kakariko Village just in time to witness Colin, who pushed Beth out of harm's way, being kidnapped by [[King Bulblin]]. Later on in the game, the young hero must lead [[Telma]]'s caravan from [[Hyrule Castle Town]] all the way to Kakariko in order to bring the dying [[Ralis]] to Renado, the only person capable of saving the young [[Zora]] boy.<ref>{{Cite|That old coot reminded me, though... I've heard of a shaman in Kakariko Village, in the Eldin lands, who's tended Gorons and Zoras.|Telma|TP}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Looks like we've got one young swordsman left! And not only that, but it looks like this brave young man will escort us, so get ready to go, honey. Pronto!|Telma|TP}}</ref> After successfully reaching the village and placing Prince Ralis in the village's care, Queen Rutela makes an apparition to Link and beckons him to follow her to the graveyard, where she rewards him with the [[Zora Armor]] for saving her son before passing to the afterlife.<ref>{{Cite|I am deeply grateful to you for aiding my son in his time of need.|Rutela|TP}}</ref>

After obtaining the [[Mirror Shard]] in the [[Temple of Time (Dungeon)|Temple of Time]], Link will receive a letter from Renado urging him to visit the village again because he has a clue on how to [[Retrieval of Ilia's Memory|restore Ilia's memory]]. Ilia eventually recovers her memory with the help of the [[Horse Call]], an item which she gives to Link inside the sanctuary to aid him on his quest.

Kakariko Village is last seen during the ending credits when the Ordon children are saying their farewells to Luda and Renado as they prepare to return to Ordon Village with the help of [[Rusl]] and his caravan.

==={{ALBW|-}}===
In {{ALBW}}, Kakariko Village appears almost identical to its {{ALttP|-}} appearance. It is located in the westernmost part of [[Hyrule]], located directly south of the [[Lost Woods]], and north of the desert. There are numerous shops, merchants and buildings in the town, and it even has its own [[Weather Vane]], located in the same position as the Weathercock in {{ALttP|-}}.

While the village is almost exactly alike to its {{ALttP|-}} predecessor, there are still some locations worth noting. The [[Milk Bar]] is located to the south, where Link can purchase [[Milk]]; it is also the basis for a bottle sidequest later on. There is a smaller shop located in the northern part of the village, where Link can purchase [[Shield]]s, [[Scoot Fruit]], and [[Foul Fruit]]. A [[Street Merchant]] can also be found in the village, slightly to the west of the Weather Vane. 

Other notable items Link can receive here are empty [[Bottle]]s, the [[Smooth Gem]], after its quest is initiated and it is purchased from the village merchant, the [[Bee Badge]], and the [[Bug Net]]. Link can also take part in the [[Fortune's Choice]] mini-game, which is found on the east side of town. [[Gramps]] is found in the western region of the village, and teaches Link about using ''StreetPass''.

Kakariko Village's Lorulean counterpart is {{Term|ALBW|Thieves' Town|link}}, which is home to the [[Thieves' Hideout (A Link Between Worlds)|Thieves' Hideout]] and is where Link will find the portrait of the Sage [[Osfala]].

Kakariko Village has three [[Lost Maiamai]]s hidden in it. One can be found on top of the roof with a rock on it - this requires a [[Cucco]] and the Power Bracelets to reach. Another is behind the Cucco Lady's house, in the patch of sand. It requires the [[Sand Rod]] to unearth it. The final one is in the tree in the southwest of town, and must be knocked down with the [[Pegasus Boots]].

==={{BotW|-}}===
In {{BotW}}, Kakariko Village is a settlement in the [[West Necluda]] region of Hyrule, north of the [[Dueling Peaks]]. One hundred years ago, during the Great Calamity, it avoided damage from the Guardian's assault.<ref>{{Cite Book|quote= |book=CaC|publisher= |page=398}}</ref> It contains several houses, gardens, and a selection of stores, including [[High Spirits Produce]], a general store where travelers can purchase locally grown food and supplies; [[Shuteye Inn]], which allows travelers to rest and regenerate [[Heart]]s; [[The Curious Quiver]], a store that specializes in [[Arrow]]s; and [[Enchanted]], a boutique that sells [[Armor]].

Link is told to go to Kakariko Village after completing the four [[Ancient Shrine]]s located on the [[Great Plateau]], when the [[Old Man]] reveals himself to be the former King of Hyrule and informs Link of the events that transpired 100 years ago. After his explanation, [[King Rhoam]] suggests that Link travel east to Kakariko Village where he can find the Village elder, [[Impa]]. Upon his arrival, several people recognise him for who he is due to the Sheikah Slate, those being Nanna, who used to work with ancient technology, her granddaughter Lasli, and Impa's bodyguards [[Cado]] and [[Dorian]]. The farmer [[Steen]] comments on how Link looks like the Hylian [[Champion]] from a century prior, but dismisses his claims of being that hero as Link is missing the [[Master Sword]]. Link is introduced to Impa's granddaughter, [[Paya]], who after noticing the [[Sheikah Slate]] dangling from his hip, affirms that Link is indeed the hero her grandmother told her about and urges him to meet with her quickly. Impa notices that Link has lost his [[Memory]] upon their reunion and recounts to him the history of the [[Divine Beast]]s, urging him to free them from Ganon's evil influence. Additionally, she also tells Link that the director of the Hateno Ancient Tech Lab, [[Purah]], might be able to unlock the full potential of his Sheikah Slate if he speaks with her. If Link has reclaimed at least one of his lost Memories, Impa will also gift him his old [[Champion's Tunic]].

Kakariko Village features a [[Fairy Fountain]] in a forested plateau overlooking the Village. Link is directed to the Fountain by [[Pikango]] through the [[Main Quest]] "[[Find the Fairy Fountain]]". After giving the weakened [[Great Fairy]] [[Cotera]] her requested sum of [[Rupee]]s, she will henceforth offer to upgrade Link's Armor in exchange for [[Material]]s in gratitude. An Ancient Shrine is also located near the Fountain, the [[Lakna Rokee Shrine]], though it is initially buried. Later on in the game, an ancient Sheikah heirloom found within Impa's house is stolen, greatly distressing both Impa and Paya. They suspect that someone must have infiltrated their home during the night, and ask Link to investigate the situation, beginning the [[Shrine Quest]] "The Stolen Heirloom." It is later revealed that [[Dorian]], one of Impa's gatekeepers, was once a member of the [[Yiga Clan]], and that he tipped off a [[Yiga Blademaster]] about the ancient heirloom in order to preserve Impa's and Paya's lives. Once recovered, the heirloom is used to reveal the Lakna Rokee Shrine.

Stylistically, Kakariko Village is dramatically different from its previous incarnations in the series. In previous installments, as a [[Hylian]] settlement, the village adopted traditional [[Medieval elements in The Legend of Zelda Universe#Buildings|medieval architecture]]. In {{BotW|-}}, Kakariko Village is a {{Term|BotW|Sheikah|link}} settlement, having an aesthetic reminiscent of several historic periods of Japan, such as the {{Wp|Asuka period|Asuka}} and {{Wp|Jōmon period}}s. Kakariko is very important to the clan as 20 of the 21 Sheikah NPCs have lived there at some point. All the Researchers were originally accommodated there at some point before moving to the Tech Labs, as was [[Pikango]] until he decided to travel the world in search of scenic landscapes{{Fact}}. The only one who hasn't was [[Granté]], but that is because he was born and raised in the [[Akkala Ancient Tech Lab]] before settling in [[Tarrey Town]].

==Other Appearances==
==={{LCT|-}}===
{{Ambig|Start}}
In {{LCT}}, Kakariko Village is the setting for a level in {{Term|LCT|Level 3|link}} as a '''Target Shooting Mode''' scenario. The stage begins in front of [[Malo Mart]], where the pace is set. Several targets will pop up briefly and then disappear. The first of the two [[scarecrow]]s show up on the right side of the screen. After the 20-second interval is up, the screen pans over to the [[Elde Inn]]. However, instead of the frontal view the other scenes in this stage use, it is set at a tilted angle. Again, targets will appear and disappear rapidly. This level normally ends in front of {{Term|TPHD|Barnes|link}}' [[Bomb Shop]]. The bomb shop has a few explosive barrels around it, the expected targets, and a [[Bee]] hive, which should never be shot. The alternative end scene takes place in [[Eldin (Spirit)|Eldin]]'s spring. Eldin's spring offers nothing to attack Link, normal targets, and gold targets.
{{Ambig|End}}

{{Noncanon|Start}}
[[File:Kakariko Village (comic).png|thumb|right|Kakariko Village in the {{ALttP|-}} comic]]
In the {{ALttP|Ishinomori}}, Kakariko Village serves as a prominent location in Link's journey. It is here where the young hero befriends several townsfolk, including the [[Librarian]], [[Sahasrahla's Wife]] and [[Sahasrahla's Grandson]], who end up helping him in his quest to rescue [[Princess Zelda]].

Link first visits Kakariko Village at the advice of the [[Old Man]] in the [[Sanctuary (A Link to the Past)|Sanctuary]], who tells him to look for [[Sahasrahla]]. However, when he arrives to Sahasrahla's house, he finds it in the care of his wife, who tells him that Sahasrahla left when he found out that [[Agahnim]] was responsible for the missing maidens and does not know where he has gone.<ref>{{Cite Book|quote= Well, young man, when the maidens began to disappear, the rumors began to fly.

==Trivia==
*In one of the houses in Kakariko Village from {{ALttP|-}}, a  portrait of {{smw|Mario}} can be found. If Link pulls on it, he will obtain [[Rupee]]s.
*In {{OoT|-}}, the Village's theme song in the past differs from the theme heard in the future. The future Village's version of the theme is known as the orchestrated version.
*Segments of [[Windfall Island]]'s music in {{TWW}} are a remix of [[Kakariko Village]]'s theme. The music was also remixed in {{TP|-}} where it can be heard when Link calms down [[Epona]] in Kakariko Village.
*Although the Village's theme song is featured in {{FSA|-}}, it is used for the [[Village of the Blue Maiden]] and not Kakariko Village itself.

==Nomenclature==
The name "Kakariko" may have originated from ''cocorico'', a French onomatopoeia for the sound of a crowing rooster. It may also come from the Spanish verb ''cacarear'', which means the crowing of a chicken. This is probably due to the fact that {{Plural|Series|Cucco|link}} appear in every incarnation of {{Term|Series|Kakariko Village}}. The {{Term|Series|Kakariko Village|display=Village}}'s name in the French versions is in fact ''Cocorico''.
