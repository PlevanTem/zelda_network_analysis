==Features and Overview==
==={{TLoZ|-}}===
Lake Hylia is located in the center of Hyrule in {{TLoZ}}. {{Term|TLoZ|Level 1|link}} can be found on a island in the northeastern part of the Lake.<ref>{{Cite Book|quote= The initial dungeon's entrance is cut into a large tree, found by crossing a long bridge over Lake Hylia.|book= E |publisher= Dark Horse Books|page= 144}}</ref> {{Term|TLoZ|Level 4|link}} can be found on another island in the southwestern area, which can only be accessed with the [[Raft]].

==={{ALttP|-}}===
In {{ALttP}}, Lake Hylia is located in southeast Hyrule and has a network of small caves coming off it. The lake itself is fed from [[Zora's River]], which in turn flows from [[Death Mountain]].

In both its Light and [[Dark World]] incarnations, the lake is filled with [[Zora (Enemy)|Zora]] who will attack [[Link]] upon sight. In the center of the lake is an island featuring the [[Pond of Happiness]] that is inhabited by [[Venus]], the [[Fairy Queen|Queen of Fairies]], who will upgrade Link's ability to carry [[Bomb]]s or [[arrow]]s in exchange for [[Rupee]]s. Outside the pond is a warp tile that grants access to the [[Ice Palace]] located in the [[Dark World]]'s [[Ice Lake]], which has several ice platforms across the lake.

In addition, the [[Ice Rod]] item is found in the [[Ice Cave]] on the northeastern side of the lake, as well as the [[Golden Bee]], a [[Bottle]]d insect that can be unleashed to attack foes.

==={{OoT|-}}===
In {{OoT}}, Lake Hylia is located in the southern region of Hyrule and is home to the sunken {{Term|OoT3D|Water Temple|link}}, which is used by the Zoras to worship the water spirits.<ref>{{Cite|At the lake bottom there is a Water Temple used to worship the water spirits. The Zoras are guardians of the temple.|Kaepora Gaebora|OoT}}</ref> The lake is made up of various islands, with the largest one bearing a lone tree as well as the pedestal that serves as the [[warp]] point for the "[[Serenade of Water]]." It is connected to [[Hyrule Field]] and has an underwater tunnel that serves as a shortcut to [[Zora's Domain]], although it is blocked by ice once Link turns into an adult. All of the lake's water comes from [[Zora's Fountain]], passing through [[Zora's River]], then [[Gerudo Valley]], and eventually reaching Lake Hylia.<ref>{{Cite|All of the water in Hyrule flows from Zora's Fountain. That water flows through Zora's River, which eventually reaches Lake Hylia to the south.|Zora|OoT}}</ref> As such, it is possible to reach the lake by floating down the river from Gerudo Valley. Also on the shore of Lake Hylia are two [[Scarecrow]]s named [[Pierre]] and [[Bonooru]], the latter of which helps Link obtain the [[Scarecrow's Song]]. Other notable features of Lake Hylia include the [[Lakeside Laboratory]], where various experiments are conducted to discover the lake's mysteries, and the [[Fishing Hole|Fishing Pond]], where Link can [[Fishing|fish]] for an unlimited time for just 20 [[Rupee]]s.<ref>{{Cite|Lakeside Laboratory / Daily trying to get to the bottom of the mysteries of Lake Hylia! --Lake Scientist|Sign|OoT}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Well, do you want to go fishing for 20 Rupees?|Fisherman|OoT}}</ref>

Link first visits the lake as a child while looking for [[Princess Ruto]], where he finds [[Letter in a Bottle|Ruto's Letter]] encased in a bottle at the bottom of the lake. Later, after the young hero turns into an adult by pulling the [[Master Sword]] from its [[Pedestal of Time|pedestal]], Link returns to find the lake almost drained of its rich waters. He discovers that the lake has been drained as a result of [[Morpha]]'s curse. With the help of Princess Ruto, Link sinks to the bottom of Lake Hylia using the [[Iron Boots]] and the [[Zora Tunic]] to reach the Water Temple and defeat Morpha.<ref>{{Cite|This ice is created by an evil curse... The monster in the Water Temple is the source of the curse. Unless you shut off the source, this ice will never melt....|Sheik|OoT}}</ref> Once Ruto awakens as the [[Sage|Sage of Water]], the lake is filled with water again, returning it to its normal state.<ref>{{Cite|Together, you and Princess Ruto destroyed the evil monster! Once again, the lake is filled with pure water. All is as it was here.|Sheik|OoT}}</ref> Furthermore, Link can stand on a stone tablet above the Water Temple's entrance and shoot an arrow at the sun as it rises to have the [[Fire Arrow]]s appear on the small, lone island.<ref>{{Cite|When water fills the lake, shoot for the morning light.|N/A|OoT}}</ref>

{{Main|Lake Hylia (Four Swords Adventures)}}
[[File:Lake Hylia FSA.png|thumb|right|300px|The uppermost waterfall of Lake Hylia in {{FSA|-}}]]
In {{FSA}}, Lake Hylia is the first stage of [[Whereabouts of the Wind]], the first level of the game. The [[Links]] land in this area after they are flung away from [[Hyrule Castle]] by [[Vaati]]'s tornado, and are awakened by the voice of [[Kaepora Gaebora]], who tells them that they must rescue [[Princess Zelda]] and the six [[Maiden]]s. Lake Hylia differs from previous games as instead of a singular, large lake, it consists of a series of small lakes and rivers, as well as giant waterfalls and cave tunnels. It is here that the young heroes also meet [[Tingle]] for the first time, who is trapped under a stone beneath the lakeside's wooden bridge. The lake leads to a cave entrance, where four [[Barrier#Vaati's Barrier|dark barrier]]s must be broken with the [[Four Sword]] in order to yield passage to the [[Cave of No Return]].

==={{TMC|-}}===
{{Term|TMC|Lake Hylia}} is an area in {{TMC}}, located in eastern {{Term|TMC|Hyrule|link}}. It connects to two other areas: {{Term|TMC|Lon Lon Ranch|link}} to the west and {{Term|TMC|Minish Woods|link}} to the south.

The water enters the {{Term|TMC|Lake Hylia|display=Lake}} by a river from {{Term|TMC|Veil Falls|link}} to the north. To the south is the {{Term|TMC|Minish Woods|link}} and to the west is {{Term|TMC|Lon Lon Ranch|link}}. {{Term|TMC|Stockwell|link}}, the shop-owner from {{Term|TMC|Hyrule Town|link}}, owns a house here where his [[dog]] {{Term|TMC|Fifi|link}} lives alone. Moreover, {{Term|TMC|Waveblade|link}}, one of the {{Term|TMC|Blade Brothers|link}}, houses a [[tree]], ready to teach {{Term|TMC|Link}} sword techniques. {{Term|TMC|David Jr.|link}} is also found here.

One of {{Term|TMC|Lake Hylia}}'s most notable features is the {{Term|TMC|Temple of Droplets|link}}, a frozen {{Term|TMC|Minish|link}}-sized temple which serves as the fourth {{Term|TMC|Dungeon|link}} of the game. After {{Term|TMC|Link}} completes the {{Term|TMC|Fortress of Winds|link}} and receives the {{Term|TMC|Ocarina of Wind|link}}, he warps to the {{Term|TMC|Wind Crest|link}} located in {{Term|TMC|Lake Hylia}} and speaks to the nearby {{Term|TMC|Forest Picori|link}}, who compliments {{Term|TMC|Link}} for finding him. Upon hearing that {{Term|TMC|Link}} is seeking to enter the {{Term|TMC|Temple of Droplets}}, the {{Term|TMC|Minish}} tells him that only one {{Term|TMC|Minish}}, {{Term|TMC|Librari|link}}, was able to find a way into it and directs him to the {{Term|TMC|Royal Hyrule Library|link}} in {{Term|TMC|Hyrule Town}} where {{Term|TMC|Librari}} lives in semi-retirement.<ref>{{Cite|Oh, ho! A visitor! How rare! But you have found me, the wisest of the wisest of the wise! You what? You want to enter the temple you can see in the lake? They call that place the Temple of Droplets. I have heard rumors that one Minish actually did find a way in, long ago... That Minish is Elder Librari, and he is in semi-retirement in the town library. The library should be opening soon. Perhaps you can go find him.|Forest Minish|TMC}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Yes, the elder Librari once found an entrance to the Temple of Droplets. And now, he lives in the town library! And this is all the wisdom of the wisest of the wise I have to offer to you!|Forest Minish|TMC}}</ref> After speaking to the {{Term|TMC|Minish}} at {{Term|TMC|Lake Hylia}}, the {{Term|TMC|Royal Hyrule Library}} opens to the public, allowing {{Term|TMC|Link}} to enter and speak with {{Term|TMC|Librari}}. The {{Term|TMC|Minish}} located at {{Term|TMC|Lake Hylia}} is also a possible target for [[Kinstone Fusion]]. If {{Term|TMC|Link}} successfully fuses {{Plural|TMC|Kinstone Piece|link}} with him, the vines covering a tree in the {{Term|TMC|Western Wood|link}} will clear, allowing {{Term|TMC|Link}} to enter the tree and obtain the {{Term|TMC|Piece of Heart|link}} inside.<ref>{{Cite|They fit perfectly! I wonder, does that mean we're in for good luck?|Forest Minish|TMC}}</ref>

==={{TP|-}}===
[[File:Twilightlake hylia.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Lake Hylia covered in Twilight in {{TP|-}}]]
In {{TP}}, Lake Hylia is located on the {{exp|GCN version; east in the Wii version|west}} side of Hyrule and is part of the [[Lanayru Province]]. The lake is home to [[Lanayru (Spirit)|Lanayru]]'s [[Spring of the Spirit Lanayru|Spirit Spring]], [[Fyer]]'s Cannon Rides, and [[Falbi]]'s [[Flight-by-Fowl]]. The [[Lakebed Temple]] rests at the bottom of the lake, where [[Zora]]s patrol the entrance to the temple due to it being a sacred place for their people.<ref>{{Cite|The dark power that you seek... It waits in a temple set in the bed of Lake Hylia.|Lanayru (Spirit)|TP}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|The other Zoras are all on guard patrol at the bottom of the lake. The bottom of this lake is a sacred place for us Zoras.|Zora|TP}}</ref> Lake Hylia is again fed by [[Zora's River]], which travels all the way from the throne room of [[Zora's Domain]]. The only ways to access Lake Hylia are by playing Falbi's Flight-by-Fowl game, playing [[Iza]]'s [[Rapids Ride]] game, jumping down from outside the South Gate of Castle Town, or [[Warping]] there. Despite this, many of Hyrule's citizens come to Lake Hylia to send prayers to Lanayru.<ref>{{Cite|We've had a ton of complaints from citizens who can't send prayers to the spring spirit of Lake Hylia.|Soldier|TP}}</ref>

When Link first visits Lake Hylia, it is covered in [[Twilight]] and has been mostly drained due to Zora's Domain being frozen, which stopped the water from flowing into the lake.<ref>{{Cite|Now that we've seen it, it's not like we can ignore what's happening in Zora's Domain. Unless we can melt the ice, the water will never be restored to Lake Hylia.|Midna|TP}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|At this rate, the lake will most definitely vanish if we don't somehow get water from Zora's Domain upstream...|Zora|TP}}</ref> After Link and [[Midna]] thaw Zora's Domain with the [[Molten Shard]] from Death Mountain, the water flow returns and fills up the lake, allowing the young hero to visit Lanayru at his Spring and obtain the [[Vessel of Light]] to collect the [[Tears of Light]] of the Lanayru Province. Collecting 15 Tears of Light will make the last [[Shadow Insect]] appear in the middle of the lake, which is actually an oversized monster known as [[Twilit Bloat]]. Twilit Bloat's defeat allows Link to collect the last Tear of Light, abolishing the Twilight and returning light to the province.

Later on in the game, Link must visit the lake once again to meet with [[Auru]] at the tower situated on the {{exp|GCN version; east in the Wii version|west}} side of the area. Auru hands Link [[Auru's Memo|a memo]] to give to Fyer so that the young hero will be able to reach [[Gerudo Desert]] and thus reach the [[Mirror Chamber]].<ref>{{Cite|Don't tell me you plan to enter the desert and confirm my suspicions with your own eyes?! Now, I've been investigating other ways to enter the desert. You see Lake Hylia below us? A man named Fyer runs an amusement ride of sorts there. Give him this. If you leave the rest up to Fyer, all should go well.|Auru|TP}}</ref> When Link must visit the [[City in the Sky]] in search of a [[Mirror Shard]], he must bring Fyer the broken [[Sky Cannon]] that is found beneath the [[Sanctuary (Twilight Princess)|Sanctuary]] in [[Kakariko Village]]. For a fee of 300 Rupees, Fyer will repair the Sky Cannon, allowing Link to visit the dungeon at any time from the Sky Cannon's new position at Lake Hylia.

Lake Hylia is also home to three [[Piece of Heart|Pieces of Heart]] as well as a mini-game hosted by [[Plumm]] known as the [[Fruit Pop Flight Challenge]].

==={{ALBW|-}}===
Lake Hylia appears in {{ALBW}}, located southeast of [[Hyrule Castle]]. It features the [[House of Gales]], the second dungeon in the game, on an island at its center, located where the Pond of Happiness was in {{ALttP|-}}. Link cannot reach the dungeon until he has obtained the [[Flippers]] from Queen [[Oren]] of the Zoras, which she gives to him as thanks for returning her stolen [[Smooth Gem]], and cannot enter it without renting the [[Tornado Rod]] from [[Ravio]].

Lake Hylia's counterpart in Lorule is dubbed [[Lorule Lake]], with a fiery maze at its center known as {{Term|ALBW|Turtle Rock|link}} serving as analogous to the House of Gales in Hyrule. Gaining access to the dungeon requires Link to come to the aid of three turtles that are trapped in various predicaments across the lake; doing so prompts their [[Mama Turtle|mother]] to thank him by allowing him a ride atop her back, which Link can use to reach the dungeon's entrance.

Lake Hylia also features a hidden cave that houses [[Mother Maiamai]], a character who will upgrade any one item that Link has purchased from Ravio for every ten [[Lost Maiamai]]s that the hero finds and returns to her.

==={{BotW|-}}===
Lake Hylia is located in the [[Central Hyrule]] [[Region]] in {{BotW}}. It is a large body of [[Water]] fed by the [[Hylia River]] from the north. The [[Bridge of Hylia]] spans across the northern and southern sides of the Lake. [[Hylia Island]] rests in the western side of the Lake. In the southwestern part of the Lake, three wooden [[Treasure Chest]]s containing a [[Fishing Harpoon]], a bundle of 10 [[Arrow]]s, and a bundle of five [[Shock Arrow]]s, respectively, can be found floating in the waters. Three metallic Treasure Chests containing an [[Amber]], an [[Opal]], and a bundle of five [[Ice Arrow]]s, respectively, can be found underwater in the northwestern part of the Lake. Two metallic Treasure Chests containing a bundle of five Shock Arrows, and a [[Purple Rupee]], respectively, can be found in the northwestern part of the Lake near a docked [[Raft]]. In the northeastern part of the Lake near a waterfall, two metallic Treasure Chests can be found containing a bundle of five Ice Arrows, and a Purple Rupee, respectively. In the eastern part of the Lake, a metallic Treasure Chest can be found containing a bundle of five Shock Arrows. North of the small cluster of islands located in the eastern part of the Lake are two more metallic Treasure Chests containing a bundle of five Shock Arrows and a Purple Rupee, respectively. Another wooden Treasure Chest containing a [[Knight's Claymore]] can be found in the far southeastern corner of the Lake. West of it is a cluster of three wooden Treasure Chests containing a bundle of five Shock Arrows, a [[Silver Shield]], and an Opal, respectively. Still west of that cluster is another cluster of three wooden Treasure Chests containing a bundle of five Shock Arrows, a [[Giant Boomerang]], and a [[Purple Rupee]]. Near the southeastern part of the Bridge of Hylia is another docked Raft.

A sunken metallic cube can be found near the cluster of wooden Treasure Chests in the southwestern part of the Lake. Link can put it in its corresponding spot on the mural using the [[Magnesis Rune]] to find a [[Korok]],<ref>{{Cite|Yahaha! You found me!|Korok|BotW}}</ref> who will give Link a [[Korok Seed]]. A second Korok can be found under a [[Rock]] on the western shore, who will give Link a Korok Seed. A third Korok can be found after Link steps on a [[Tree]] stump located on the northwestern shore and reaches the marker in the allowed time, who will give Link a Korok Seed. Link can find a fourth Korok, who will give him a Korok Seed, near the cluster of islands in the eastern part of the Lake by using the Magnesis Rune to complete the metallic cubes pattern. A fifth Korok can be found, who will give Link a Korok Seed, by walking near the [[Pinwheel]] and busting out the three balloons that will appear. A sixth Korok can be found by destroying an [[Acorn]]-shaped {{Term|BotW|Vase}} placed in a [[Tree]], who will give Link a Korok Seed, in the far southeastern corner of the Lake. A seventh Korok can be found, who will give Link a Korok Seed, by lifting a Rock on the southeastern shore of the Lake.
