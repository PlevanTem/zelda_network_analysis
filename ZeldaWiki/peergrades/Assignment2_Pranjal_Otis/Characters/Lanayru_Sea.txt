The {{Term/Store|Lanayru Sea||Series, SS, BotW}} is a recurring location in {{TLoZ|Series}}.<ref>{{Cite Book|quote= |book= E |publisher= |page= 58 {{Exp Game|SS}}}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Lanayru Sea|Map|BotW}}</ref>

==Features and Overview==
==={{SS|-}}===
The {{Term|SS|Lanayru Sea}} was a treacherous ocean that had receded long before the events of {{SS|-}}.<ref>{{Cite|You got the {{Color|SS Yellow|Ancient Sea Chart}}! This old map details the area as it was long ago, before the sea succumbed to the desert sand.|N/A|SS}}</ref> Due to rapid climate change, an area of the {{Term|SS|Lanayru Sea}} would later become the {{Term|SS|Lanayru Sand Sea|link}},<ref>{{Cite|A report, Master. This is {{Color|SS Light Blue|Lanayru Sand Sea}}. This whole area was once a vast ocean. But the water has all evaporated, and now the area is a sea of sand. Signs indicate that this place functioned as a port, linking the land to the sea. This area operated on a new form of power. There is a 90% probability that the sacred flame is located ahead. I recommend exploring this sand sea.|Fi|SS}}</ref> and eventually {{Term|Series|Gerudo Desert|link}}.

During the events of {{SS|-}}, {{Term|SS|Link}} is tasked to retrieve an {{Term|SS|Ancient Sea Chart}} in order to navigate the waters lost to time.<ref>{{Cite|If you're going to navigate these treacherous waters, then you need a proper {{Color|SS Yellow|sea chart}}, doo-weep! There is a {{Color|SS Yellow|sea chart}} in my shack at {{Color|SS Light Blue|Skipper's Retreat}}, bzzzt. So first you need to get on this boat and set a course for {{Color|SS Light Blue|Skipper's Retreat}}!|LD-301N Skipper|SS}}</ref>

==={{BotW|-}}===
In {{BotW}}, the {{Term|BotW|Lanayru Sea}} is a body of water to the east of the {{Term|BotW|Lanayru (Region)|link}} {{Term|BotW|Region|link}}, south of {{Term|BotW|Tingel Island|link}}. {{Term|BotW|Spool Bight|link}} is located in the Lanayru Sea.

==Trivia==
*The map within {{Term|SS|Skipper's Retreat|link}} depicts the {{Term|SS|Sealed Grounds|link}} in the {{Term|SS|Faron (Region)}} region, which implies the {{Term|SS|Lanayru Sea}} existed sometime after the {{Term|SS|Ancient Battle|link}} with {{Term|SS|Demise|link}}. However, as the map was likely created using {{Plural|SS|Timeshift Stone|link}}, it may have receded long before.
*This map may also indicate that the {{Term|SS|Lanayru Province|link|display=Lanayru}}, {{Term|SS|Faron Province|link|display=Faron}} and {{Term|SS|Eldin Province|link}} were separated by an inland sea. The area underneath the sea would later become {{Term|Series|Hyrule Field|link}}.{{Fact}}
