==Characteristics==

{{Compendium/Extract|Meteo Wizzrobe}}
Meteo Wizzrobes are a stronger variant of the [[Fire Wizzrobe]]. They attack by using their [[Meteor Rod]]s to conjure 3 [[Fire]]balls as well as by summoning flaming monsters such as [[Fire Chuchu]]s and [[Fire Keese]]. They are also able to increase the area's temperature, making it too hot for Link without heat-resistant [[Armor]] or [[Elixir]]s.<ref>{{Cite|They use their meteor rods to hurl fireballs or to summon flaming monsters and have been known to severely raise the temperature around them.|Hyrule Compendium|BotW}}</ref> The Meteo Wizzrobe, like other Wizzrobes, will become invisible after attacking, leaving ripples in the air with each footstep. Striking it in the head with an Arrow will stun it and give Link time to attack. Hitting it with an ice attack, such as with [[Ice Arrow]]s or a [[Frostblade]], will immediately evaporate the Wizzrobe. Upon defeat, Meteo Wizzrobes drop their Meteor Rod.
