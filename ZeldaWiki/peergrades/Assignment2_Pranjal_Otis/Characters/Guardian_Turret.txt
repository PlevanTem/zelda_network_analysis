{{Term/Store|Guardian Turret|Guardian Turrets|Series, BotW|plural}} are recurring {{Plural|BotW|Enemy|link}} in {{TLoZ|Series}}.<ref>{{Cite|'''{{Color|BotW Shrine Quest|Guardian Turret}}'''|Hyrule Compendium|BotW}}</ref>{{Name Ref|HWAoC}}

==Characteristics==
==={{BotW|-}}===
{{Compendium/Extract}}
{{Plural|BotW|Guardian Turret}} are a type of {{Term|BotW|Guardian|link}} that do not move, but instead fire powerful lasers at {{Term|BotW|Link|link}}. They are only found around {{Term|BotW|Hyrule Castle|link}}, in the {{Term|BotW|Trial of the Sword|link}}, and in the {{Term|BotW|Final Trial|link}}. Several {{Plural|BotW|Guardian Turret}} guard the entrance to the {{Term|BotW|Sanctum|link}} of {{Term|BotW|Hyrule Castle}}, where {{Term|BotW|Calamity Ganon|link}} resides. Most Guardian Turrets appear in their corrupted state, though one uncorrupted one can be found in {{Term|BotW|Upland Zorana|link}} as part of the {{Term|BotW|Main Quest|link}} "{{Term|BotW|EX Champion Mipha's Song|link}}", which is exclusive to {{TCB}} DLC Pack. Another can be found in the {{Term|BotW|Final Trial|link}}.

Upon spotting {{Term|BotW|Link|link}}, their head will begin to elevate and they will charge their laser in preparation to shoot. Sometimes when firing their lasers, they will fire in rapid succession if their health is low enough and {{Term|BotW|Link}} has not moved too far from when they fired their last laser. These rapid lasers will not damage {{Term|BotW|Link}}, and will stop if {{Term|BotW|Link}} gets hit, if {{Term|BotW|Link}} is no longer within their range, or at a random stopping point. Some {{Plural|BotW|Guardian Turret}} can lock {{Term|BotW|Link}} between a wall and itself during this rapid shooting phase, and trap {{Term|BotW|Link}} there for an extended period of time. If a {{Term|BotW|Guardian Turret}} is hit from behind, they will malfunction similarly to a {{Term|BotW|Decayed Guardian}} and start shooting lasers in whatever direction they were facing.

If {{Term|BotW|Link}} hits a {{Term|BotW|Guardian Turret}} in its eye using a {{Term|BotW|Bow|link}}, it will temporarily stun it. Sometimes when doing this, the {{Term|BotW|Guardian Turret}} may retract or extend its head in order to mess up {{Term|BotW|Link}}'s aim. Using [[Stasis|Stasis +]] on a charging up {{Term|BotW|Guardian Turret}} will stun them afterwards, even if not hit during Stasis +.

In {{Term|BotW|Master Mode|link}}, {{Plural|BotW|Guardian Turret}} will sometimes take slightly longer in their charge up phase before firing their laser to throw off {{Term|BotW|Link}}'s timing.
