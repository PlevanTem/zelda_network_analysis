==Characteristics==
{{Compendium/Extract|White-Maned Lynel}}
White-Maned Lynels are the white and black-colored variant of [[Lynel]]s. They have been in [[Hyrule]] since ancient times and only a few amount of witnesses of this breed survive to tell the tale.<ref>{{Cite|These fearsome monsters have lived in Hyrule since ancient times.|Hyrule Compendium|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|There are so few eyewitness accounts of this breed because a White-Maned Lynel is not one to let even simple passersby escape with their lives.|Hyrule Compendium|BotW}}</ref> Like other Lynels, it will often refrain from attacking for a short period of time after spotting Link, instead opting to stare down its opponent. However, they start their battle by roaring out loudly and slamming its Weapon down to causing a fiery explosion around itself. Being a higher tier variant from the [[Blue-Maned Lynel]]s, it is known to carry a stronger set of "Savage" Lynel gear, such as a [[Savage Lynel Sword]], [[Savage Lynel Shield]], [[Savage Lynel Bow]], [[Savage Lynel Spear]], and a [[Savage Lynel Crusher]].

In [[Master Mode]], they carry "Mighty" Lynel gear. One also appears on the [[Great Plateau]] carrying a Savage Lynel Crusher and Savage Lynel Bow.
