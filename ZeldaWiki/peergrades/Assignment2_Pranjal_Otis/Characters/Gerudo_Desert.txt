==Features and Overview==
==={{TP|-}}===
The Gerudo Desert is found in the [[Desert Province]] in {{TP}}, located in the {{exp|GCN version; southeast in the Wii version|southwest}} corner of [[Hyrule]]. Although called Gerudo Desert, the [[Gerudo]] themselves do not appear in {{TP|-}}. The Gerudo Desert is completely cut off from the rest of Hyrule after being abandoned years ago. At first, Link can only reach it by being shot out of [[Fyer]]'s cannon and can only leave by [[Warping]] out. According to [[Auru]], the Desert once held a prison to hold Hyrule's worst criminals.<ref>{{Cite|The Gerudo Desert once held a prison built to hold the worst criminals this land has ever known... The criminals who were sentenced to death were sent directly to the underworld by a cursed mirror that was kept in the prison...Now that prison is condemned, and even the road leading to the Desert is impassable.|Auru|TP}}</ref> The Gerudo Desert covers a vast territory, but most of its surface is a barren wasteland with no signs of life other than enemies like [[Moldorm]]s, [[Shadow Beast]]s, [[Bulblin]]s and [[Leever]]s.

The Gerudo Desert holds the [[Arbiter's Grounds (Dungeon)|Arbiter's Grounds]] [[Dungeon]], the aforementioned prison. On top of it lies the [[Mirror Chamber]], a large circular temple where the [[Sage#Twilight Princess|Sages]] reside. It houses the [[Mirror of Twilight]], which is the only way to access the [[Twilight Realm]]. The Mirror of Twilight can create a portal inside a gigantic rock that leads to the [[Palace of Twilight]]. The mirror was shattered into four pieces by [[Zant]], but the three missing pieces are recovered by [[Link]] and [[Midna]]. After the defeat of [[Ganondorf]], Midna departs to the Twilight Palace and shatters the mirror completely. The [[Gerudo Mesa]] can also be found in the Gerudo Desert. It holds the [[Cave of Ordeals]], an optional 50-floor dungeon.

==Other Appearances==
{{Ambig|Start}}
==={{LCT|-}}===
In {{LCT}}, the Gerudo Desert appears in two stages. In the first appearance, during [[Link's Crossbow Training#Stage 1|Stage 1]], Link faces a constant onslaught of [[Stalfos]] rising from the sand. The skeletal warriors approach slowly and several Automatic Crossbow upgrades can be obtained by defeating enemies that glow green. Bonus point items are much less common in this barren setting.

The second appearance, during [[Link's Crossbow Training#Stage 5|Stage 5]], is the same as Stage 1 but with different enemies. [[Moldorm]]s will circle Link from under the sand, jumping occasionally, which is the opportunity to shoot them. Between swarms of Moldorms, a group of [[Leever]]s will encircle Link before attacking.
