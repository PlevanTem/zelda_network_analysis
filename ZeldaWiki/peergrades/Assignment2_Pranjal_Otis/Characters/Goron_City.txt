It is the home of the [[Goron]] Tribe.<ref>{{Cite|Land of the Gorons / Goron City|Sign|OoT}}</ref> It is located in close proximity to [[Death Mountain]].

==Features and Overview==
==={{OoT|-}}===
Goron City is the main gateway to [[Death Mountain Crater]] and, ultimately, the {{Term|OoT3D|Fire Temple|link}}. It also has a portal that leads to the [[Lost Woods]], but its entrance is blocked by rocks that [[Link]] must destroy with [[Bomb]]s. Paintings of the Gorons, the Dodongos, and other abstract shapes can be seen all around the city walls. The structure consists of four floors, with the entrance being at the top floor. The lowest floor has the two most important locations of Goron City: the [[Goron Shop]] and Darunia's chamber, the latter of which is initially closed off until [[Zelda's Lullaby|proof of connection with the Royal Family]] is shown. Within Darunia's chamber is a stone monument that blocks off the entrance to Death Mountain Crater which Link will only be able to move once he turns into an adult.

Also on the bottom floor is a giant, spinning vase that only functions once all of the torches around the city are lit up. Situated at the center of the city is a platform suspended by ropes where the Spiritual Stone of Fire, also known as the [[Spiritual Stones#Goron's Ruby|Goron's Ruby]], was once displayed which used to light up the city before Darunia took it away.<ref>{{Cite|"Spiritual Stone?" That red stone that was lighting up our city? Big Brother Darunia took it away. Then, he shut himself up in his room and won't come out.|Goron|OoT}}</ref>

When young Link arrives to Goron City, he finds that the Gorons are in a sort of predicament: their source of food, [[Dodongo's Cavern]], has been blocked by a giant boulder, which is endangering the way of life of the Gorons.<ref>{{Cite|Everyone feels faint from hunger because of the food shortage in this town. We are in danger of extinction! It's all because we can't enter our quarry, the Dodongo's Cavern. We Gorons live on a diet of rocks... And the most delicious and nutritious rocks around are found in the Dodongo's Cavern! But that seems like ancient history now...|Goron|OoT}}</ref> Their leader has locked himself up in his chamber and won't allow entry to anyone who is not associated with the [[Royal Family of Hyrule]].<ref>{{Cite|Big Brother has shut himself up in his room saying, "I will wait in here for the Royal Family's messenger!"|Goron|OoT}}</ref> Once Link shows his [[Zelda's Lullaby|proof of connection with the Royal Family]], the door to Darunia's room opens, allowing Link to speak to the Goron chief. Darunia, though reluctant at first,<ref>{{Cite|This is a Goron problem! We don't need any help from strangers!|Darunia|OoT}}</ref> agrees to let Link help them by destroying the [[Dodongo]]s in Dodongo's Cavern.<ref>{{Cite|Why don't you go destroy the monsters inside of the Dodongo's Cavern and prove you're a real man? That way, everybody will be happy again! If you do it, I will give you anything you want, even the Spiritual Stone!|Darunia|OoT}}</ref> After Link defeats [[King Dodongo]] and clears the infested cavern, Darunia grants the young hero the Goron's Ruby and grants him the title of Sworn Brother.<ref>{{Cite|Kid, I like you! How's about you and I become Sworn Brothers?! No, there's no big ceremony involved! Just take this as a token of our friendship!|Darunia|OoT}}</ref>

Seven years later, after Link retrieves the [[Master Sword]], he returns to Goron City to find that all of its citizens are gone. He notices a lone Goron rolling around the third floor, and, after much trouble, Link manages to stop him using a Bomb. The Goron turns out to be [[Link (Goron)#Ocarina of Time|Darunia's son]], who informs the young hero about the revival of the ancient dragon known as [[Volvagia]]. Due to this, Darunia left to the Fire Temple to try and defeat the dragon; however, while he was gone, all the Gorons were taken by [[Ganondorf]] as prisoners to the temple in order to feed them to Volvagia as a warning to those who might oppose him.<ref>{{Cite|Everybody was taken to the Fire Temple... While my dad was out... Ganondorf's followers came and took them all away! All of them will be eaten by Volvagia! Dad said that Ganondorf revived Volvagia... As a warning to those who might oppose him, Ganondorf is going to feed them all to Volvagia! Dad went to the Fire Temple all by himself to try to save everyone...|Link (Goron)|OoT}}</ref> Darunia's son informs the Hero of Time that Darunia headed to the Fire Temple in an attempt to save everyone, but he pleads for Link's aid to go and help the Goron chief. To do so, Darunia's son grants him the heat-resistant tunic known as the [[Goron Tunic]], which helps Link stay in the intense heats of the [[Death Mountain Crater]] and the Fire Temple for long periods of time.<ref>{{Cite|Please help, Link! I'll give you this heat-resistant tunic!|Link (Goron)|OoT}}</ref>

Once Link rescues all the Gorons from the Fire Temple, they will return to their city and thank Link for saving them.<ref>{{Cite|Thank you very much for saving us!|Goron|OoT}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Brother Link! Everybody has come back! Dad and you destroyed the dragon together, didn't you!|Goron|OoT}}</ref>

[[File:BotW Daruk Statue.png|right|thumb|300px|The statue of Daruk in Goron City]]
Goron City is located west of [[Death Mountain]] in [[Eldin Canyon]]. One hundred years ago, it spared any direct damage during the Great Calamity.<ref>{{Cite Book|quote= |book=CaC|publisher= |page=400}}</ref> A winding road leading from the entrance to Eldin from [[Trilby Valley]] paves the way to the settlement. Unlike Goron City's previous appearance, the Gorons no longer inhabit a cave complex, but have instead built a little town surrounding a pool of lava, which is crossed by bridges. The Gorons live and commerce inside of stone shanties. The road passing through Goron City continues to the [[Abandoned North Mine]], where a tunnel further ahead leads to the [[Stolock Bridge]], a long bridge that crosses overhead Goron City before continuing to Death Mountain. A statue of rocks in the likeness of [[Daruk]], the deceased Goron [[Champion]], stands near the Bridge overlooking the City, accompanied by a statue of {{Term|BotW|Darmani III|link}} and the {{Term|BotW|Goron Elder's Son|link}}, both of {{Term|BotW|Termina|link}}, and the once head elder {{Term|TP|Gor Coron|link}}.

Goron City is home to several businesses, including the [[Goron Gusto Shop]], [[Protein Palace]], [[Ripped and Shredded]], and [[Rollin' Inn]]. A Goron child named [[Offrak]] also sells [[Fireproof Elixir]]s for 60 [[Rupee]]s to travelers who cannot withstand the heat.<ref>{{Cite|Here's what I'll do, fella. Just for you, I'll sell ya that {{Color|BotW Blue|fireproof elixir}} at a special price of only {{Color|BotW Red|60 rupees}}!|Offrak|BotW}}</ref>

Link arrives to Goron City on his quest to free the {{Term|BotW|Divine Beast Vah Rudania|link}} from [[Calamity Ganon]]'s influence. There he meets the Gorons' Boss, [[Bludo]], who explains to him that the Gorons have been using [[Cannon]]s to drive away Vah Rudania.<ref>{{Cite|I can't tell ya how many times we've used the {{Color|BotW Red|cannon}} to chase off that fiend.|Bludo|BotW}}</ref> Bludo was planning to use the Cannon again, but is unable to due to his chronic back pain.<ref>{{Cite|I was plannin' to drive off {{Color|BotW Blue|Rudania}} like I always do, but then this blasted pain in my back flared up outta nowhere...|Bludo|BotW}}</ref> He had sent his assistand and Daruk's grandson, [[Yunobo]], to the Abandoned North Mine to retrieve him some painkillers, but he had yet to return.<ref>{{Cite|He went to grab some painkillers for my back from the {{Color|BotW Red|Abandoned North Mine}}, but he hasn't come back yet...|Bludo|BotW}}</ref> Bludo sends Link to find Yunobo in his stead, beginning the "[[Divine Beast Vah Rudania (Quest)|Divine Beast Vah Rudania]]" [[Main Quest]]. Link manages to find Yunobo and returns to Bludo, who then tells him about Daruk and points to his statue, invoking a [[Memory]] of him in Link. However, even after taking the painkillers, Bludo's back is still too sore and he asks Link to tell Yunobo that he is forced to cancel their plans.<ref>{{Cite|I hate to put you on the spot, but... can ya please go tell Yunobo that I'm gonna have to cancel for today? He should be at {{Color|BotW Red|Eldin Bridge}}.|Bludo|BotW}}</ref> When Link reaches the Bridge of Eldin, he finds Yunobo being harassed by two [[Black Moblin]]s.

Later, after Link has boarded the Divine Beast Vah Rudania and defeated [[Fireblight Ganon]], freeing Vah Rudania from its influence, he returns to Goron City and is rewarded for his efforts. Bludo gives him the [[Boulder Breaker]], a sword that Daruk once wielded, which is stored inside of a [[Treasure Chest]] in Bludo's house.<ref>{{Cite|... Oh, right! I've still gotta thank you, brother! There's some {{Color|BotW Blue|treasure}} in my house. Grab it. Keep it. It's yours. It's a sharp blade that Daruk himself once wielded. I'm sure you'll be able to make good use of it!|Bludo|BotW}}</ref>

In addition to the Main Quest, Link also meets other characters in Goron City who give him other Quests. The [[Side Quest]]s "[[The Road to Respect]]" and "[[The Jewel Trade]]", and the [[Shrine Quest]] "[[A Brother's Roast]]", all begin here.

Goron City's economy is driven by the mining and selling of gemstones to the other races of Hyrule.<ref>{{Cite Book|quote= |book= CaC |publisher= |page= 123}}</ref>

====Goron Gusto Shop====
{{Main|Goron Gusto Shop}}
The '''Goron Gusto Shop''' is a general store managed by [[Tanko]]. The store stocks in a few items, including [[Rock Salt]], [[Cane Sugar]] and [[Fire Arrow|Fire]] and [[Ice Arrow]]s. It is also the only Place where Link can reliably get [[Goron Spice]], as [[Stamm]] and [[Yammo]] only sell it on rainy days.

====Protein Palace====
{{Main|Protein Palace}}
'''Protein Palace''' is an outdoor kitchen run by [[Aji]] that specializes in selling food that has been [[Cooking|grilled]], specifically one [[Seared Steak]], one [[Roasted Bass]] and one [[Toasty Hylian Shroom]]. [[Offrak]] can be found sleeping here at night, implying he has some relation with Aji, though this isn't expanded upon in-game.

====Ripped and Shredded====
{{Main|Ripped and Shredded}}
'''Ripped and Shredded''' is an [[Armor]] shop managed by [[Rogaro]] that sells the [[Flamebreaker Armor]] equipment. Speaking to Rogaro when not wearing any of the flamebreaker armour causes him to panic, so most interactions are cut short until you equip a bit. A Goron named [[Pyle]] sits outside it, as he lost his Job as a miner because of [[Divine Beast Vah Rudania]] and has nothing else to do.

====Rollin' Inn====
{{Main|Rollin' Inn}}
'''Rollin' Inn''' is an inn managed by [[Tray]], who provides a mostly pain free massage that will cause you to feel as "loose as gravel", and gives Link three temporary [[Heart]]s and one temporary ring of [[Stamina]], for the cost of 80 [[Rupee]]s. An elderly Goron named [[Volcon]] stands outside of the Inn, encouraging travelers to stay. The traveling [[Sheikah]] painter [[Pikango]] can be found sleeping here when Link does not have the [[Memory]] from the corresponding area, as can [[Ramella]], though she'll only be willing to trade after the "{{Term|BotW|Divine Beast Vah Rudania (Quest)|link}}" {{Term|BotW|Main Quest|link}} is complete.

== Other Appearances ==

=== ''Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity'' ===
In [[Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity]], Link and Zelda go to Goron City in order to ask [[Daruk]] to pilot [[Divine Beast]] [[Divine Beast Vah Rudania|Vah Rudania]]. However, that is the only mention of Goron City in the [[Scenario]], "[[Daruk, the Goron Hero]]," and the characters go to [[Death Mountain]].
