The {{Term/Store|Great Plateau||Series, BotW}} is the starting region in {{BotW}}.<ref>{{Cite|'''Great Plateau'''|Map|BotW}}</ref>

==Features and Overview==
The Great Plateau is a large region of land that is secluded from other parts of [[Hyrule]], as its steep slopes prevent anyone from traveling to and from it without special equipment, such as the [[Paraglider]].<ref>{{Cite|Here, on this isolated plateau, we are surrounded on all sides by sheer cliffs, with no way off or down. If you were to try and jump, well...no death could be more certain. Or foolish. Of course, if you had a paraglider like me, that would be quite another story!|Old Man|BotW}}</ref> The only active inhabitant is the [[Old Man]], a mysterious elderly fellow with a deep knowledge of the [[Sheikah]].<ref>{{Cite|Seems you managed to get your hands on a Spirit Orb! Well done! [Paraglider, please?] Let's slow down for a moment there, my young friend. The appearance of those towers and the awakening of this shrine... It's all connected to that Sheikah Slate you carry on your hip there. [What do you mean?] It has been quite some time since I've seen or heard of the Sheikah Slate... Long ago, an advanced civilization known as the Sheikah inhabited these lands. It was the power and wisdom of the Sheikah that saved this land time and time again. But their civilization disappeared long ago...or so it is said. It is interesting, however, to think...that something of them might still remain hidden away in a shrine such as this. These shrines are tucked away in numerous places all across this land.|Old Man|BotW}}</ref>

According to the Old Man, the Great Plateau is the location where the Kingdom of Hyrule was founded.<ref>{{Cite|This is the Great Plateau. According to legend, this is the birthplace of the entire kingdom of Hyrule.|Old Man|BotW}}</ref> As such, it is a sacred place where no monsters are meant to roam.<ref>{{Cite web|quote= This area is supposed to be a sacred area, where people can't easily come nor any type of monsters. But, now they actually do, so the story is: "What's going on here?"|author= Eiji Aonuma|published= June 14, 2016|retrieved=June 28, 2016|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dar1t_L2wBk?t=4m58s|title= The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Beyond the Plateau Gameplay - Nintendo E3 2016|site= YouTube|type=video}}</ref> However, due to the [[Calamity Ganon]]'s growing influence, it has been corrupted by enemies. The Great Plateau features numerous changes in [[Master Mode]], such as the inclusion of a [[White-Maned Lynel]] in the forest north of the [[Old Man's Cabin]] as well as the addition of several Treasure Chests guarded by [[Sky Octorok]]s. When traversing, you will find several camps with no inhabitants.

===Eastern Abbey===
{{Main|Eastern Abbey}}
[[File:BotW Eastern Abbey.png|thumb|right|250px|The Eastern Abbey with an inactive Guardian]]
The '''Eastern Abbey''' is a ruin surrounding [[Ja Baij Shrine]] on the eastern edge of the Great Plateau. The Eastern Abbey contains several broken down [[Guardian (Breath of the Wild)|Guardian]]s, three of which are still active and will come alive to attack Link if he comes within range of them. The formal entryway to the Ja Baij Shrine is blocked by a bombable wall, which can be broken with a Guardian's laser, [[Bomb Arrow]]s or with the [[Remote Bomb Rune]] after retrieving it from inside the Shrine. There is also a metal wall you can lift with [[Magnesis]], with which you can place it on top of the wall to make a ramp.

===Forest of Spirits===
{{Main|Forest of Spirits}}
The '''Forest of Spirits''' is a heavily-wooded area in the north of the Great Plateau. It is lush with wildlife, inhabited by [[Boar]]s and birds as well as a plethora of organic plant-based [[Material#Breath of the Wild|Material]]s. An uninhabited camp containing a campfire and a Cooking Pot can be found in the eastern reaches of the Forest of Spirits, allowing Link to cook various [[Food]]s with the Materials littered across the Forest floor. This camp also contains basic weaponry, such as the [[Traveler's Bow]] and a [[Torch|Torch]]. Also found in the Forest of Spirits is an enormous hollow log with the top rotted away, inside which a tall yellow flower can be found. If Link tries to approach this flower, it will vanish, and reappear a short distance away. After it does this several times, it reveals itself to be a [[Korok]]. Another Korok can be found by lifting the rock on the top of the small, strangely shaped hill.

A [[Stone Talus]] can be found in a rocky clearing in the Forest.

===Great Plateau Tower===
[[File:BotW Great Plateau Tower.png|thumb|right|250px|The Great Plateau Tower overlooking Hyrule Castle]]
{{Main|Sheikah Tower}}
The Great Plateau Tower is a [[Sheikah Tower]] situated in the northeastern region of the Great Plateau. Initially, it is buried beneath the surface of the Great Plateau, requiring Link to use his [[Sheikah Slate]] to reactivate it. Upon reactivation, it causes a chain reaction across Hyrule, raising Sheikah Towers across all of Hyrule and activating all [[Ancient Shrine]]s throughout Hyrule.<ref>{{Cite|My my... It would seem that we have quite the enigma here. This tower and several just like it have erupted across the land, one after another. Very interesting... It appears that some long-dormant power has awoken quite suddenly. Did anything...odd happen to you while you were on top of that tower?|Old Man|BotW}}</ref>

===Hopper Pond===
{{Main|Hopper Pond}}
The '''Hopper Pond''' is a small body of water found west of the Forest of Spirits. A group of Bokoblins have established an encampment beside the Pond, guarding their treasure. Due west of Hopper Pond is another Bokoblin encampment.

===Mount Hylia===
'''Mount Hylia''' is a cold and snowy region in the Great Plateau, based beside the River of the Dead. It is dotted with several Bokoblin camps, and is inhabited with ice-themed enemies. [[Keh Namut Shrine]] lays near a frigid pond in northwestern region, and [[Owa Daim Shrine]] rests on the far eastern border of the mountain. After raising the Great Plateau Tower, if Link climbs up to its peak in the center, he is greeted by the Old Man, who teaches him about the [[Scope]] ability on Link's [[Sheikah Slate]].<ref>{{Cite|Ahhh... I enjoy gazing out at the world from here. [B-b-breathtaking view...] This may be the best place to get a full view of the entire plateau. Did you know about the {{Color|BotW Blue|scope}} on your {{Color|BotW Blue|Sheikah Slate}}? Look through it, and you can stick a pin anywhere you'd like to mark on the map. <br/>The pins on your {{Color|BotW Blue|map}} serve as reference points for your travels. Just stick a pin anywhere you're interested in! [How do you know?] Oho ho! Just a few tricks I've picked up after many, many years in the wild... You may take my advice or leave it. Go ahead and take a look if you feel inclined to do so. |Old Man|BotW}}</ref> If Link has climbed to the peak using only [[Food]]s that give him Cold Resistance, the Old Man will be impressed with his ability to travel so far in the cold without proper attire, and gives Link the [[Warm Doublet]].<ref>{{Cite|You did well to make it this far without the proper clothing. Please take this warm doublet as a reward for your tenacity. I assume you will want to try it on right away, yes? I thought you might be eager to see how it looks... It's quite fetching! Well, I suppose it matters not. It is yours now. Do take care to put it on before you get too cold, though.|Old Man|BotW}}</ref> On the stone wall near Keh Namut Shrine, a Korok can be found hiding inside a chunk of ice.

The peak contains a cairn from which Link may find minerals and similar Materials through searching.

===River of the Dead===
{{Main|River of the Dead}}
[[File:BotW River of the Dead.png|thumb|right|250px|The River of the Dead]]
The '''River of the Dead''' is a frigid body of water fed by Mount Hylia. It is located on the western portion of the Great Plateau. There are two magnetic pieces, which can be used to make a makeshift bridge. There are some chests in the up the River.

{{Main|Shrine of Resurrection}}
The Shrine of Resurrection is where Link first awakens, upon hearing a voice pleading for his return to save Hyrule. It is situated in the center of the Great Plateau.

===Ancient Shrines===
{{Main|Ancient Shrine}}
The Great Plateau bears four Ancient Shrines: [[Ja Baij Shrine]], [[Keh Namut Shrine]], [[Oman Au Shrine]] and [[Owa Daim Shrine]]. Link is tasked with the responsibility of clearing each of these Shrines in order to retrieve the treasure, the {{Plural|BotW|Spirit Orb|link}}, granted by the eponymous [[Monk]]s residing in each Shrine. In exchange for this treasure, the Old Man offers his Paraglider,<ref>{{Cite|[Give it to me!] Har har har! Sure! Why not? But there is no such thing as a free item in this world, you know. Let's see now... How about a trade for a bit of treasure that slumbers nearby? Come. Let me show you something.|Old Man|BotW}}</ref> the only tool capable of allowing Link to leave the Great Plateau. After the [[Breath of the Wild Expansion Pass|Expansion Pass]] is purchased, three chests appear on the Great Plateau. One is found on the top of a wall within sight of Ja Baij Shrine, another to the left of Oman Au Shrine, and the third on the thick wall bordering the Plateau near Keh Namut Shrine. These chests are of a purple and silver coloration, and have the letters "EX" on the front. They contain the [[Nintendo Switch Shirt]], a [[Ruby]], and five [[Bomb Arrow]]s, respectively.

===Temple of Time===
[[File:BotW Temple of Time Climbing.png|thumb|right|250px|Link climbing the Temple of Time]]
{{Main|Temple of Time}}
The Temple of Time is situated near the center of the Great Plateau, at the foot of the River of the Dead. With the decay of the Kingdom of Hyrule, it has fallen into disrepair, but it was once used frequently for sacred rites.<ref>{{Cite|That temple there... Long ago, that was the site of many sacred ceremonies. Since the decline of the kingdom, it now sits abandoned, in a state of decay. Yet another forgotten entity. A mere ghost of its former self...|Old Man|BotW}}</ref> Inside rests a [[Statue of the Goddess]], [[Hylia]], which Link can pray to in order to receive her blessing.<ref>{{Cite|The goddess smiles upon you.|N/A|BotW}}</ref> After Link has four {{Plural|BotW|Spirit Orb|link}}, he can receive a [[Heart Container]] or [[Stamina Vessel]] from the Goddess. 

===Old Man's Cabin===
{{Main|Old Man's Cabin}}
The [[Old Man's Cabin]] is a small building based in the southwestern region of the Great Plateau.
