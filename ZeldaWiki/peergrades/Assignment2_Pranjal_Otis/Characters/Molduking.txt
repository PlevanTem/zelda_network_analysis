The {{Term/Store|Molduking||Series, BotW}} is an overworld boss in {{BotW}}.<ref>{{Cite|'''{{Color|BotW Shrine Quest|Molduking}}'''|Hyrule Compendium|BotW}}</ref> It's exclusive to {{TCB}} DLC Pack.

==Characteristics==
{{Compendium/Extract|Molduking}}
The Molduking is a boss first appearing as part of the [[Divine Beast Tamer's Trial]] in the "{{Term|BotW|EX Champion Urbosa's Song|link}}" {{Term|BotW|Main Quest|link}}. The Molduking is a giant {{Term|BotW|Molduga|link}} that gained power by resting underground for centuries, absorbing iron into its skin to bolster its defensive capabilities far beyond its Molduga counterparts.<ref>{{Cite|This massive monster swims beneath the desert's sand. It is a subspecies of Molduga that stored up a great deal of energy by sleeping underground for hundreds of years. Its power is superior to Molduga, as its skin is rich with iron and acts as a protective shield.|Hyrule Compendium|BotW}}</ref> Consequently, the Molduking is seen with a {{Term|BotW|Gerudo Spear|link}}, {{Term|BotW|Golden Claymore|link}}, {{Term|BotW|Rusty Broadsword|link}}, {{Term|BotW|Rusty Halberd|link}}, and a {{Term|BotW|Throwing Spear|link}} sticking out of its hide, indicating failed attempts to slay it.

In the "EX Champion Urbosa's Song" Main Quest, Link must slay the Molduking in order to make the [[Keive Tala Shrine]] appear.<ref>{{Cite|The scattered One-Hit Obliterator led you to a location where a stone monument with a map of trials appeared. Kass's song seems related...<br><br>One, {{Color|BotW Red|fight the brute of the sand}},<br>Two, {{Color|BotW Red|chase rings upon the land}},<br>Three, {{Color|BotW Red|throw the orb underground}},<br>Champion, trials abound!<br><br>You still have {{Color|BotW Red|three}} trials to complete.|EX Champion Urbosa's Song|BotW}}</ref> After the Molduking has been defeated, it will reappear in the East Barrens after every [[Blood Moon]].

{{Term|BotW|Teake|link}} has heard about the Molduking, claiming it's been sighted recently.<ref>{{Cite|I hear a strange type of {{Color|BotW Red|Molduga}} was spotted near {{Color|BotW Red|East Barrens}} recently.|Teake|BotW}}</ref> She also says that {{Term|BotW|Traysi|link}} went out to investigate it.<ref>{{Cite|A Hylian named {{Color|BotW Blue|Traysi}} went there looking for...how did she put it..."a hot scoop."|Teake|BotW}}</ref> Traysi can be found on a mesa nearby, where she shares that {{Term|BotW|Gerudo|link}} have tried fighting it, but they couldn't make a dent.<ref>{{Cite|Apparently the Gerudo soldiers tried fighting it, but normal swords didn't even make a dent.|Traysi|BotW}}</ref> When Link defeats it, Traysi asks to write all about it.<ref>{{Cite|Hey, you! I saw everything! I can't believe you were able to defeat that weird {{Color|BotW Blue|Molduga}}... I'm speechless! ME! OK, not really. But this has SCOOP written all over it! Mind if I...write a tell-all about you?!|Traysi|BotW}}</ref> However, she takes Link's silence as a denial.<ref>{{Cite|I see. How unfortunate.|Traysi|BotW}}</ref>

Similar to its Molduga counterparts, the Molduking swims beneath the desert sand in search of prey. When it detects prey moving upon the sand, the Molduking will rush towards the disturbance and leap into the air, attempting to consume anything nearby in its mouth. Link can trick the Molduking into exposing itself by throwing {{Plural|BotW|Remote Bomb|link}} or shooting {{Plural|BotW|Bomb Arrow|link}} at the sand near it. If it is struck by either explosive force while in the air, the Molduking will fall to the desert floor and temporarily lie stunned.

Like the {{Term|BotW|Igneo Talus Titan|link}}, the defeat of the Molduking does not count towards its respective {{Term|BotW|Medal of Honor|link}}.

==Nomenclature==
The {{Term|BotW|Molduking}}s' name comes from {{Term|Series|Molduga|link}} and {{Wp|King}}, referencing how it is the strongest {{Term|Series|Molduga}} around.
