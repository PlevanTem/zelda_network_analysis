==Biography==
Kula can be found wandering around near [[The Great Deku Tree]] in [[Korok Forest]]. Upon speaking to them, they welcome Link to the forest enthusiastically.<ref>{{Cite|Hey! Are you the hero? Could it be? Welcome to Korok forest! You're... much, much cooler looking than I thought you'd be!|Kula|BotW}}</ref> They offer Link a trial, the [[Side Quest]] "[[A Freezing Rod]]", in which he must show them an [[Ice Rod]].<ref>{{Cite|Hooray! Show me a {{Color|BotW Red|rod with the power of ice}}, please!|Kula|BotW}}</ref>

After showing Kula the Ice Rod, they are extremely impressed.<ref>{{Cite|Shimmering! Sparkling! What a sight to behold!|Kula|BotW}}</ref> As thanks, they give Link 100 [[Rupee]]s.<ref>{{Cite|Thank you, Mr. Hero. Your weapon is so amazingly, wonderfully sparkly! I must give you something as thanks!|Kula|BotW}}</ref>

If shown a [[Blizzard Rod]] Kula will instead give Link 300 [[Rupee]]s.<ref>''"Is that a blizzard rod?! Incredible shimmer! Unbelievable sparkle!"'' â€” [[Kula]] ([[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|Breath of the Wild]])</ref>
