==Features and Overview==
The Eldin Mountains are a mountain range in far northwestern [[Eldin (Region)|Eldin]]. Its mountains stretch to the far west of northern [[Hyrule]] toward [[Hebra]], directly north of the [[Great Hyrule Forest]]. The range extends as far as [[Mount Drena]] and the [[Forgotten Temple]].

The range is a highly mountainous area, consisting densely of tall peaks, steep foothills, and difficult terrain. The Mountains border along the northern ends of Hyrule, where a vast, bottomless cliff, an extension of [[Eldin's Flank]] of the [[Eldin Canyon]], runs beside it. The eastern range consists largely of a dead and barren wasteland, characterized by its dead trees and scattered skeletal remains. This landscape is also shared with northern Eldin Canyon.  Further towards the west, the Eldin Mountains gradually turn more lively with grassy foothills and a few trees, but remains rugged for most of the entire stretch.

{{Plural|BotW|Mountain Goat|link}} and [[Maraudo Wolf|Maraudo Wolves]] inhabit the Mountains throughout.
