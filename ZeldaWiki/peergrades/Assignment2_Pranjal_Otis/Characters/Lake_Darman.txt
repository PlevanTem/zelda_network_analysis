==Features and Overview==
Lake Darman is a medium-sized lake of lava in northeastern [[Eldin Canyon]]. It is supplied by an inflow of lava from [[Death Mountain]]'s moat. From there, the Lake extends to the larger [[Darunia Lake]] west, followed by the [[Golow River|Golow]] and [[Goronbi River]]s, and finally [[Goronbi Lake]].

An [[Igneo Talus]] is buried in the Lake's southern shore.

==Nomenclature==
Lake Darman's name is derived from [[Darmani III]], the late [[Goron]] warrior from {{MM}}.
