==Biography==
Saula is a [[Gerudo]] who manages the [[Armor Shop]], [[Fashion Passion]], in [[Gerudo Town]]. If [[Link]] speaks to her, she compliments him for his [[Gerudo Top]] and encourages him to try out more colors.<ref>{{Cite|Sav'aaq! Oooh, that {{Color|BotW Blue|Gerudo top}} looks really good on you...|Saula|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|But you haven't really lived until you've got {{Color|BotW Blue|several colors}} to choose from! What do you say?|Saula|BotW}}</ref> If Link asks about the different colors, Saula expresses surprise that he does not know and explains that dyeing clothing is popular for "young vai" right now.<ref>{{Cite|You don't know? Really?! Changing the color of your clothes is a really trendy thing to do right now for young vai traveling beyond town!|Saula|BotW}}</ref> She goes on to tell Link about the [[Kochi Dye Shop]] in [[Hateno Village]] where he can dye his [[Armor]].<ref>{{Cite|There's a store in Hateno Village—the {{Color|BotW Blue|Kochi Dye Shop}}—where you can dye your clothes!|Saula|BotW}}</ref> However, she states that not many get to travel there due to its large distance from Gerudo Town.<ref>{{Cite|Hateno Village is pretty far away, though. Not everyone gets to go there...|Saula|BotW}}</ref> Saula also states that it is hot and expresses her desire to get a cold drink at [[The Noble Canteen]].<ref>{{Cite|It's really hot today, isn't it? Makes me want to get an ice-cold something from the canteen.|Saula|BotW}}</ref>

Through the doorway behind Fashion Passion is a curtain that conceals an entrance to the [[Gerudo Secret Club]]. If Link attempts to enter, Saula stops him, telling him that the doorway is not for customers.<ref>{{Cite|Ah, um, that doorway isn't for customers, actually...|Saula|BotW}}</ref> Saula then whispers to Link and tells him to use the door on the side of the building if he is a member.<ref>{{Cite|<small>If you're a member, please head around to the door on the side.</small>|Saula|BotW}}</ref> Saula knows about the Gerudo Secret Club, and is likely a member, as suggested by [[Yaido]] if Link eavesdrops on the Gerudo in The Noble Canteen. Yaido reveals that she overheard Saula say that the password to enter the Gerudo Secret Club is "GSC♦."<ref>{{Cite|Oh, that's right, the password! It's {{Color|BotW Red|GSC♦}}. I overheard Saula talking about it, so I'm sure that's right!|Yaido|BotW}}</ref>
