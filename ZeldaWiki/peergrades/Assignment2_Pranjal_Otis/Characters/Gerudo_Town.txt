==Other Appearances==

==Trivia==
*In the palace in {{BotW|-}}, {{Term|BotW|Riju}}'s throne and the stone tablets to the left and right of it have {{Term|BotW|Gerudo (Language)|link|display=Gerudo}} words inscribed on them. When deciphered, the throne reads, "A RESILIENT DESERT FLOWER, FACING THE SUN'S GAZE, GERUDO GROWS BRILLIANT, WHILE OTHERS". The tablet to the left reads, "WE STAND VIGILANT, IN THE DESERT SUN WE ARE BRILLIANT, OVER EVERYONE". The tablet to the right reads, "VIGILANT IN THE SUN GROWING BRILLIANT GERUDO NEVER OUTDONE". In addition, the pedestal that displays the {{Term|BotW|Thunder Helm}} reads, "BRILLIANT IN THE SUN".
*Despite being a place where only females are allowed two male Gorons (a race that has no notable female members) are shown to be in the city with [[Lyndae|one]] of them outright commenting on it by questioning why he was allowed in even though he is male. This further implies that the Gorons are a male only race.
