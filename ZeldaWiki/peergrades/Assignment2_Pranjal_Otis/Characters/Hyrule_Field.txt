In {{MM}}, there is a parallel version of Hyrule Field called [[Termina Field]]. Though the many game-specific regions of Hyrule often have a large field common to and one that connects all areas of the map, only those specifically labeled as Hyrule Field are of any significance. 

==Features and Overview==
==={{OoT|-}}===
Hyrule Field is a large round area that acts as the hub or crossroads of Hyrule in {{OoT}}. All other areas of the game branch out from this region. However, there is little activity, and besides a few side-quests, it serves little purpose other than maintaining the illusion of a vast land. 

Located in the center of Hyrule Field is [[Lon-Lon Ranch]], and all other areas dwell on its outskirts. At the northmost section of the field rests [[Hyrule Castle Town]], the main center of activity of Hyrule which also serves as the location of [[Hyrule Castle]]. To the northeast is [[Kakariko Village]], the primary settlement for [[Hyrulean]]s, and just north of the village is [[Death Mountain]]. [[Zora's River]] and ultimately [[Zora's Domain]] reside in the east, while the [[Kokiri Forest]] is situated in the southeast. Directly to the west of Kokiri Forest is [[Lake Hylia]], a deep, pure lake that is home to the {{Term|OoT3D|Water Temple|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|Head south from here to reach Lake Hylia's full, rich waters. [...] Beyond this point lies Lake Hylia. It is full of deep, pure water. The Zoras, who live all the way upstream, guard the sunken temple at the lake's bottom, as well as Zora's Fountain.|Kaepora Gaebora|OoT}}</ref> Lastly, [[Gerudo Valley]] is located to the west, where one the other side of the valley the gang of female thieves have established their hideout, the [[Gerudo's Fortress]].<ref>{{Cite|If you go west, you'll find Gerudo Valley. There's a hideout of a gang of thieves on the other side of the valley.|Kaepora Gaebora|OoT}}</ref>

All of the waterflow in Hyrule is a direct source from the waters in [[Zora's Fountain]], located in the northeast. This water flows through [[Zora's River]] and makes its way past Castle Town, continuing its path through the bottom of Gerudo Valley and eventually reaching its final destination: Lake Hylia.<ref>{{Cite|All of the water in Hyrule flows from Zora's Fountain. That water flows through Zora's River, which eventually reaches Lake Hylia to the south.|Kaepora Gaebora|OoT}}</ref>

As young Link, [[Stalchild]]ren burrow out of the ground during the nighttime and attack the young hero. They can be avoided by sticking to the dirt road or by wearing the [[Bunny Hood]]. [[Peahat]]s can also be found in the southern and northern corners of the field, and will attack anyone who gets too close to their territory during the day; however, if Link attacks the Peahats during the night, they will send out [[Peahat Larva]] to chase after him. Once Link turns into an adult by retrieving the [[Master Sword]] from its [[Pedestal of Time|Pedestal]], the Stalchildren and the Peahats will disappear; instead, [[Big Poe]]s as well as ordinary [[Poe]]s will roam the field, although they will only appear at certain spots.

==={{TMC|-}}===
[[File:TMC North Hyrule Field.png|thumb|right|300px|North Hyrule Field from {{TMC|-}}]]
In {{TMC}}, {{Term|TMC|Hyrule Field}} is divided into two parts on the map: {{Term|TMC|North Hyrule Field}} and {{Term|TMC|South Hyrule Field}}, with {{Term|TMC|Hyrule Town|link}} between the two locations. Other places linking to the two parts of {{Term|TMC|Hyrule Field}} include {{Term|TMC|Hyrule Castle|link}}, {{Term|TMC|Lon Lon Ranch|link}}, {{Term|TMC|Trilby Highlands|link}}, the {{Term|TMC|Eastern Hills|link}}, and the {{Term|TMC|Western Wood|link}}.

====South Hyrule Field====
{{Term|TMC|South Hyrule Field}} is the home of {{Term|TMC|Link}} and his grandfather {{Term|TMC|Smith|link}}, and houses very few enemies, most of them being {{Plural|TMC|Octorok|link}}. {{Term|TMC|Tingle|link}} also appears in {{Term|TMC|South Hyrule Field}}, standing upon a small tree stump just east of {{Term|TMC|Link's House|link}}.

====North Hyrule Field====
{{Term|TMC|North Hyrule Field}} is the main path to {{Term|TMC|Hyrule Castle|link}} and has more enemies than its southern counterpart, including {{Plural|TMC|Octorok}} and {{Plural|TMC|Crow|link}}. It is also home to {{Term|TMC|Greatblade|link}}'s dojo.

In the center of the field where four trees make a square, {{Term|TMC|Link|link}} must [[Kinstone Fusion|fuse]] {{Plural|TMC|Kinstone Piece|link}} with each of the four {{Term|TMC|Tingle Siblings?|link}}. Doing so will open each tree, where {{Term|TMC|Link}} will find {{Plural|TMC|Treasure Chest|link}} and {{Plural|TMC|Switch|link}}. When {{Term|TMC|Link}} steps on each {{Term|TMC|Switch}}, a final opening will be revealed in the center of the trees, containing a {{Term|TMC|Treasure Chest}} with the {{Term|TMC|Magical Boomerang|link}} inside. There is also a {{Term|TMC|Minish Portal|link}} in the form of a tree stump.

==={{TP|-}}===
[[File:North Hyrule Field.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Hyrule Field's northern portion from {{TP|-}}]]
In {{TP}}, Hyrule Field is almost five times larger than in {{OoT|-}} and spans three Provinces: [[Lanayru Province|Lanayru]], [[Eldin Province|Eldin]], and [[Faron Province|Faron]]. It sports more landscape variety than its previous incarnation, including bridges, rocky cliffs, woods, and ancient ruins, and unlike {{OoT|-}}, {{TP|-}} Hyrule Field is not one huge area, but several areas connected by pathways. Due to its immense size, it is easier to traverse the field with either the help of [[Epona]] or by [[warping]] through a [[Portal (Object)|Portal]].

Hyrule Field surrounds [[Hyrule Castle]] and is full of shortcuts and entrances to many other areas, including: 
*[[Faron Woods]] in the south
*[[Kakariko Village]] and [[Kakariko Gorge]] in the {{exp|GCN version; west in the Wii version|east}}
*[[Zora's Domain]] in the north
*[[Lake Hylia]] in the {{exp|GCN version; east in the Wii version|west}}
*[[Hyrule Castle Town]] in the center

Various enemies roam the field, including [[Bokoblin]]s, [[Bulblin]]s, [[Deku Baba]]s, [[Bomskit]]s, [[Guay]]s, [[Leever]]s, [[Poes]], [[Stalhound]]s (at night), [[Kargarok]]s, [[Tektite]]s, [[Helmasaurs]], [[Lizalfos]], [[Chuchu]]s, and [[Bullbos]].

Several important game events occur in the field. After [[Colin]] gets kidnapped by [[King Bulblin]], Link follows him to the {{exp|GCN version; west in the Wii version|east}} portion of Hyrule Field, where the young hero defeats King Bulblin at the [[Bridge of Eldin]]. Link must once again journey through Hyrule Field as [[Telma]], [[Ilia]] and [[Ralis]] are riding in a caravan on their way to Kakariko Village from the Hyrule Castle Town while the young hero defends Telma's caravan from enemy attacks during the ride. The last event is the final two fights against [[Ganondorf]] which take place on {{exp|GCN version; West in the Wii version|East}} Hyrule Field.

When riding Epona through Hyrule Field, a remixed version of the theme music is played, which adds brass instruments to the melody.

==={{BotW|-}}===
Unlike in previous Zelda games, Hyrule Field in {{BotW}} is completely open; all parts of the overworld will be accessible with no interruptions, whereas in previous games, different parts of the overworld were separated by loading screens. There are also enemies roaming the field such as the one shown in the game's reveal trailer.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Nintendo |retrieved=2014-06-10 |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GisRY6h100U |title=Play Nintendo - Nintendo E3 Digital Event |site=YouTube}}</ref> [[Central Hyrule]] houses Hyrule Field's location in the game.

==Other Appearances==
{{Ambig|Start}}
==={{LCT|-}}===
Hyrule Field appears in two stages of {{LCT}}. The first appearance in {{Term|LCT|Level 2|link}} is a skeet shoot scenario involving skulls. The camera angle is fixed in place, but the skulls fly in different directions. The stage also features a [[Scarecrow]] and three wooden barrels.

The second appearance of the field is in {{Term|LCT|Level 8|link}}, where Link rides on [[Epona]]. The camera angles are fixed for each 20 second sections of the stage. The first segment shows a section of Hyrule Field in daylight. Targets appear in the distance of the background as well as close enough to obstruct view of other objects. The second segment shows the field at dusk, while the final segment at night. This last segment changes the camera angle from a side-scroll scene to a forward-scrolling one.
{{Ambig|End}}

{{Noncanon|Start}}

{{Noncanon|End}}
