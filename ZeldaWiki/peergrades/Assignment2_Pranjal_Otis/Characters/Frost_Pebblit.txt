{{Term/Store|Frost Pebblit|Frost Pebblits|Series, BotW|plural}} are recurring {{Plural|Series|Enemy|link}} in {{TLoZ|Series}}.<ref>{{Cite|'''{{Color|BotW Shrine Quest|Frost Pebblit}}'''|Hyrule Compendium|BotW}}</ref> They are miniature versions of the [[Frost Talus]].

==Characteristics==
==={{BotW|-}}===
{{Compendium/Extract|Frost Pebblit}}
Frost Pebblits are mainly found in snowy areas, such as the [[Hebra Mountains]]. Due to their coloring, they often blend in with their surroundings, and are somewhat difficult to spot until they become active. Their primary attack is moving toward {{Term|BotW|Link|link}} and attempting to swipe at him with one arm.

Frost Pebblits can be fought similarly to their stone counterparts, except that coming into contact with one will cause Link to become frozen for a short period of time. This can be avoided, however, by throwing [[Remote Bomb]]s from a distance, melting the Frost Pebblit's icy coating with a heat-based weapon such as [[Fire Arrow]]s, or wearing a full set of [[Snowquill Set|Snowquill]] [[Armor]] that has been enhanced twice by a [[Great Fairy]] for the [[Unfreezable]] [[Set Bonus]], which allows the Pebblit to be picked up and thrown in order to defeat it. Frost Pebblits will explode if held by Link for too long or when they're thrown.

Once killed, each one will drop a single piece of [[Flint]], {{Term|BotW|Amber|link}}, or {{Term|BotW|Sapphire|link}}.
