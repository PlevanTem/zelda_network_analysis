==Characteristics==
==={{BotW|-}}===
{{Compendium/Extract|Fire Chuchu}}
Fire Chuchus are flaming [[Chuchu]]s that appear in hot places, such as the [[Eldin (Region)|Eldin]] Region. They leave trails of [[Fire]] behind them as they move, setting anything flammable on Fire, such as grass or wood. They attack by dashing forward and emitting a blast of Fire around them. If hit by their attack, [[Link]] is temporarily set on Fire unless he is wearing the full [[Flamebreaker Set]], which applies the [[Fireproof]] Set Bonus. After attacking, Fire Chuchus temporarily lose their fiery coating and become a darker color, leaving them vulnerable to attack. If they are defeated while on Fire, they will explode with a fiery blast. Fire Chuchus drop [[Red Chuchu Jelly]] after being defeated.

==Other Appearances==
{{Noncanon|Start}}
==={{HWAoC|-}}===
Fie Chuchus reappear in {{HWAoC}}, first appearing in. They act the same as in ''Breath of the Wild'' and drop Red Chuchu Jelly upon their defeat once again. The Giant variants reappear during the Pulse of the Ancients DLC Missions, attacking players by rolling around, spinning their bodies, slamming down into the ground, and releasing small Fire Chuchus.
