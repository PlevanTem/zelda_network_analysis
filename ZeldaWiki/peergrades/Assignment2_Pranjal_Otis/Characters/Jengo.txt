==Biography==
Jengo is a [[Goron]] miner who works at the [[Southern Mine]] in the [[Eldin Canyon]]. During the day, Jengo mines alongside [[Dorill]] and [[Greyson]] for [[Gem]]s. At night, Jengo takes his break while [[Bohrin]] works the night shift.

Jengo is focused on his work, and prefers not to be disturbed until he is on his break.<ref>{{Cite|I need to concentrate while I'm workin'. If you wanna talk, come see me when it's {{Color|BotW Red|nighttime}}.|Jengo|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Well then... Time to work. Don't talk to me while I'm workin', OK? I need to concentrate.|Jengo|BotW}}</ref> During break, Jengo mentions that the Gorons used to mine at the [[Death Mountain Summit]] before the {{Term|BotW|Divine Beast Vah Rudania|link}} appeared, forcing them to mine at the Southern Mine.<ref>{{Cite|But right now, we've got that {{Color|BotW Blue|lizard monster}} sittin' up on {{Color|BotW Blue|Death Mountain}}. Normally we can pull up good {{Color|BotW Blue|ore}} from near the mountain peak... But for now, we have to mine here instead. You should ask the {{Color|BotW Blue|Boss}} for more details. He's in Goron City.|Jengo|BotW}}</ref> He tells Link to speak with [[Bludo]], the boss of the Gorons, for more information.
