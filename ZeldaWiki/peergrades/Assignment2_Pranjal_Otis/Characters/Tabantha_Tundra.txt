==Features and Overview==
The Tabantha Tundra is a vast snowy expanse covering a large portion of eastern [[Hebra Mountains]], lying between the [[Pikida Stonegrove]] and the [[Tabantha Frontier]] in the west and [[Mount Drena]] in the east. The [[Tanagar Canyon]] and the roof of the [[Forgotten Temple]] is at the bottom of the cliff along the Tundra's southern edge and a bottomless chasm passes along the northern edge. A road between the [[Hebra Tower]] and the [[Great Hyrule Forest]] runs through the southern portion of the Tundra, passing the [[Snowfield Stable]].

The Tundra is extremely cold, requiring two layers of Cold Resistance at all times.

[[Cold-Footed Wolf|Cold-Footed Wolves]], [[Great-Horned Rhinoceros]] and [[Tabantha Moose]] inhabit the Tundra throughout.
