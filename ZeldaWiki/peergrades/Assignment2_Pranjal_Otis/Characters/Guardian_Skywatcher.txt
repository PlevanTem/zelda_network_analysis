{{Term/Store|Guardian Skywatcher|Guardian Skywatchers|Series, BotW|plural}},{{Exp Game|BotW}}<ref>{{Cite|'''{{Color|BotW Shrine Quest|Guardian Skywatcher}}'''|Hyrule Compendium|BotW}}</ref> also known as {{Term/Store|Guardian|Guardians|HWAoC|plural}},{{Exp Game|HWAoC}}{{Name Ref|HWAoC}} are recurring {{Plural|Series|Enemy|link}} in {{TLoZ|Series}}.

==Characteristics==
==={{BotW|-}}===
{{Compendium/Extract|Guardian Skywatcher}}
{{Plural|BotW|Guardian Skywatcher}} are a flying type of {{Term|BotW|Guardian|link}}. They scan their environment with a red searchlight, and will begin charging their laser upon locating {{Term|BotW|Link|link}}. Many {{Plural|BotW|Guardian Skywatcher}} patrol around {{Term|BotW|Hyrule Castle|link}}. In all locations, they're corrupted by the {{Term|BotW|Malice|link}} of {{Term|BotW|Calamity Ganon|link}}. However, three uncorrupted Guardian Skywatchers appear in {{TCB}} DLC Pack, as part of the {{Term|BotW|Main Quest|link}} "{{Term|BotW|EX Champion Mipha's Song|link}}". Another two can also be found within the {{Term|BotW|Final Trial|link}}.

{{Term|BotW|Link}} must use aerial tactics to defeat Guardian Skywatchers, either by getting close with the {{Term|BotW|Paraglider|link}}, or shooting {{Plural|BotW|Arrow|link}}. They fly with the use of propellers, which can be damaged to ground them. When firing their lasers, they will sometimes fire in rapid succession if their health is low enough and {{Term|BotW|Link}} has not moved too far from when they fired their last laser. These rapid lasers will stop if {{Term|BotW|Link}} gets hit too far from their last firing point, if {{Term|BotW|Link}} is no longer within their range, or at a random stopping point.

If {{Term|BotW|Link}} hits a {{Term|BotW|Guardian Skywatcher}} in its eye using a {{Term|BotW|Bow}}, it will temporarily be stunned. Sometimes when doing this, the {{Term|BotW|Guardian Skywatcher}} will retract its head in order to mess up {{Term|BotW|Link}}'s aim. If {{Term|BotW|Link}} is aiming at its eye while it has already retracted, its head may extend. Using [[Stasis|Stasis +]] on a charging up {{Term|BotW|Guardian Skywatcher}} will stun them afterwards, even if not hit during {{Term|BotW|Stasis}}. On death, {{Plural|BotW|Guardian Skywatcher}} lose their propellers and fall to the ground before exploding. {{Plural|BotW|Guardian Skywatcher}} may be immobilized by shooting at its propellers with a {{Term|BotW|Bow|link}}. All three propellers must be destroyed before the {{Term|BotW|Guardian Skywatcher}} falls to the ground.

In {{Term|BotW|Master Mode|link}}, {{Plural|BotW|Guardian Skywatcher}} will sometimes take slightly longer in their charge-up phase before firing their laser, in order to throw off {{Term|BotW|Link}}'s timing.
