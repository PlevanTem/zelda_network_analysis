{{Term/Store|Igneo Pebblit|Igneo Pebblits|Series, BotW|plural}} are recurring {{Plural|Series|Enemy|link}} in {{TLoZ|Series}}.<ref>{{Cite|'''{{Color|BotW Shrine Quest|Igneo Pebblit}}'''|Hyrule Compendium|BotW}}</ref> They're miniature versions of the [[Igneo Talus]].

==Characteristics==
==={{BotW|-}}===
{{Compendium/Extract|Igneo Pebblit}}
Igneo Pebblits can be found in many areas in [[Eldin (Region)|Eldin]], often near [[Lava]]. They are fairly easy to spot at night, as they glow brightly, seemingly from the veins of lava that run through their bodies. {{Term|BotW|Link|link}} will be burned if he comes into contact with one unprotected.

The main attack of Igneo Pebblits is moving toward Link and swiping at him with an arm. They can be defeated by throwing [[Remote Bomb]]s, cooling them off with a cold-based weapon such as [[Ice Arrow]]s to allow them to be safely touched, or wearing a full set of [[Flamebreaker Armor]] that has been enhanced twice by a [[Great Fairy]] for the [[Fireproof]] [[Set Bonus]]. Igneo Pebblits explode if Link holds them for too long or if they're thrown.

Once killed, each one will drop a single piece of [[Flint]], {{Term|BotW|Amber|link}}, or {{Term|BotW|Amber|link}}.
