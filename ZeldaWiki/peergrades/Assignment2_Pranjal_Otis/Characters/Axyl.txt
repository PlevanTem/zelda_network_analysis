==Biography==
Axyl is a child [[Goron]] who is found at the [[Southern Mine]] in the [[Eldin Canyon]]. During the day while the adult Gorons mine, he and [[Pelison]] play together. After Pelison leaves for [[Tarrey Town]], he will roll around the mine's pickaxe statue. At night, he mumbles in his sleep about his father and not being able to eat another bite.<ref>{{Cite|{{Small|Papa... *grumble*}}|Axyl|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|{{Small|I can't eat another bite... *grumble...*}}|Axyl|BotW}}</ref>

When spoken to, Axyl is surprised to see Link, a [[Hylian]], in the area.<ref>{{Cite|Hm? Huh? Aaaah! A {{Color|BotW Blue|Hylian}}! This is bad!|Axyl|BotW}}</ref> He wonders if Link intends to go to [[Goron City]] to sightsee,<ref>{{Cite|Are you sightseeing? Have you been to Goron City?|Axyl|BotW}}</ref> and is surprised to hear that he intends to go all the way to [[Death Mountain]].<ref>{{Cite|WHAT?! You're gonna go? All the way up the mountain?!|Axyl|BotW}}</ref> Axyl warns him that the area ahead is really dangerous due to the {{Term|BotW|Divine Beast Vah Rudania|link}}, according to his father.<ref name="Dangerous"/><ref>{{Cite|N-n-no! You can't! It's not just {{Color|BotW Blue|magma bombs}} you have to worry about... My papa says the mountain is burning hot! It's burning! It's boiling! It's on fire! Well, anyway... You get my point.|Axyl|BotW}}</ref> He tells him that he should go home and should listen to what the adult Gorons say.<ref>{{Cite|That's right! {{Color|BotW Blue|Hylians}} should go home! You should listen to grown-ups! They know what's best!!...That's what my papa says, anyway. But hey, what do I know? I'm just a kid.|Axyl|BotW}}</ref> However, he also secretly encourages him to dig for [[Gem]]s at the [[Death Mountain Summit]].<ref>{{Cite|Well, when you go to Goron City, go to the back of Death Mountain Summit and dig up some {{Color|BotW Blue|ore}}! Just don't tell anybody!|Axyl|BotW}}</ref>

If Link tells Axyl he's already been to Goron City, he will be dismissive and say goodbye.<ref>{{Cite|[Yeah, I went.] Oh. I see. Then I don't have anything to say. Bye now.|Axyl|BotW}}</ref>
