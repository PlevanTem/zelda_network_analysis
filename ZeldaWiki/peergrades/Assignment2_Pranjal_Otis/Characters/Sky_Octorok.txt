==Characteristics==
==={{SS|-}}===
Sky Octoroks only appear in [[the Sky]] in {{SS}}. They fly using the leaves on their mantles and live on the small, barren rock islands scattered throughout the Sky. As Link flies his [[Loftwing]], Sky Octoroks will fire homing rocks at him. They can be defeated by flying close and boosting through them with a [[Spiral Charge]].

==={{BotW|-}}===
{{Compendium/Extract|Sky Octorok}}
Sky Octoroks only appear in [[Master Mode]] included in DLC Pack 1, [[The Master Trials]], in {{BotW}}. They can be found all around [[Hyrule]] soaring through the skies next to bridges and [[Sheikah Tower]]s, or above bodies of water. Sky Octoroks appear in groups of three or four holding planks containing [[Treasure Chest]]s, and enemies.<ref>{{Cite web|quote= While exploring in Hard Mode, be on the lookout for planks floating in the sky.

They are harmless to Link as they cannot attack like other [[Octorok]]s. Unlike other enemies, Sky Octoroks do not need the [[Blood Moon]] to respawn and do not drop [[Material]]s when defeated.

==Other Appearances==
==={{HWAoC|-}}===
{{Noncanon|Start}}
{{Stub|HWAoC}}Sky Octoroks reappear in ''[[Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity]]'' primarily seen in the Divine Beast missions, carrying monsters just like in ''Breath of the Wild''. During the EX [[Scenario]]s, they carry [[Black Moblin]]s and [[Silver Moblin]]s while also spitting rocks for the first time since ''Skyward Sword'', though it can be countered with the [[Stasis]] Rune of the Shiekah Slate.
