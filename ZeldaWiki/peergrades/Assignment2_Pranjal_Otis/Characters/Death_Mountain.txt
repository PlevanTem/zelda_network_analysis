{{Term/Store|Death Mountain||Series, TLoZ, TP, TPHD}} is a recurring location in {{TLoZ|Series}}.{{Exp Game|TLoZ, TP}}<ref>{{Cite Book|quote= |book= E |publisher= |page= 220 {{Exp Game|TLoZ}} & 112 {{Exp Game|TP}}}}</ref> It is a tall, often volcanic mountain that can be found in [[Hyrule]], the [[Dark World]], and [[Lorule]].

==Features and Overview==
==={{TLoZ|-}}===
In {{TLoZ}}, Death Mountain is the northern region of [[Hyrule]]. It is a large sprawling expanse of rock covering the northern border of the map. The mountain range is usually home to some of the stronger enemies, such as [[Lynel]]s, who are said to be the guardians of the Mountain. Occasionally, [[Boulder]]s will fall from the hills. The Mountain also has a few streams and ponds that are home to [[Zora (Enemy)|Zora]]s.

Death Mountain also has two distinctive landmarks. The first being [[Lost Hills]], a mountainous counterpart of the maze-like [[Lost Woods]]. Beyond this maze is the fifth Labyrinth, {{Term|TLoZ|Level 5|link}}, in the First Quest. The mountain also contains [[Spectacle Rock]], which houses [[Level-9]] and the location of [[Ganon]]. This Dungeon is a huge labyrinth found underneath the Mountain itself. It is the largest Dungeon in the game and is filled with lava pools and a large number of enemies such as [[Lanmola]] and [[Wizzrobe]]s. [[Princess Zelda]] is held captive deep inside until Link rescues her.

==={{TAoL|-}}===
In {{TAoL}}, Death Mountain can be found south of [[Western Hyrule]]. This area, located south of the [[Water Town of Saria]], is comprised of many different tunnels that house many enemies, such as [[Daira]]s, several of which lead to dead ends if the wrong paths are taken. A few tunnels also have pools of lava, usually with a bridge suspended above them. Only a few paths lead to the southern region of Hyrule, where [[Link]] can find the [[Hammer]] hidden in a cave beneath Spectacle Rock.

==={{ALttP|-}}=== 
In {{ALttP}}, Death Mountain can be found on the northern border of Hyrule. It is home to many [[Deadrock]]s and numerous caves filled with [[Keese]] and [[Mini-Moldorm]]s among other enemies. At the very peak of mountain, the [[Tower of Hera (A Link to the Past)|Tower of Hera]] can be found beyond Spectacle Rock. Without traveling to the [[Dark World]], Link cannot scale this peak to reach the dungeon and the final [[Pendant of Virtue]]. Here, the  hero also meets the [[Lost Old Man]], and by saving him, he is able to start the game from his hideout in the Mountain Cave. Later on in his quest, he is able to obtain the [[Ether Medallion]] and gain access to the [[Death Mountain Shop]]. Death Mountain is covered by constantly tumbling boulders.

Its Dark World counterpart is home to {{Term|ALttP|Turtle Rock|link}} and [[Ganon's Tower (A Link to the Past)|Ganon's Tower]], found where the Tower of Hera is in the [[Light World]]. Ganon's Tower itself is guarded by Lynels. The Dark World counterpart is volcanic, with rocks constantly dripping with magma. The [[Cane of Byrna]] can also be found hidden in its caves.

==={{OoT|-}}===
In {{OoT}}, Death Mountain is home to the [[Goron]]s, a peaceful race who eat rocks and are exceptionally good at forging blades.<ref>{{Cite|I am one of the Gorons, the stone-eating people who live on Death Mountain.|Goron|OoT}}</ref> It can only be reached via a gate in [[Kakariko Village]]. Anyone wishing to travel up to Death Mountain needs the [[King of Hyrule|King]]'s permission.<ref>{{Cite|Climb up the stairs at the north end of the village to find the trail that leads up Death Mountain. But you need the King's permission to actually go up the mountain.|Soldier|OoT}}</ref> It is said that the state of the mountain is reflected by the clouds surrounding the peak: if they look normal, then Death Mountain is at peace.<ref>{{Cite|It is said that the clouds surrounding this peak reflect the condition of Death Mountain. When they look normal, it is at peace.|Kaepora Gaebora|OoT}}</ref>

The ancient dragon [[Volvagia]] was, in essence, the spirit of the Mountain.<ref>{{Cite Book|quote= Residing within the Fire Temple in {{OoT|-}}, Volvagia was a wicked dragon defeated by Link; in essence, it was the spirit of Death Mountain. |book= E |publisher= |page= 22}}</ref>

==={{FS|-}}===
{{Main|Death Mountain (Four Swords)}}
In {{FS}}, Death Mountain appears as one of the four initial stages. By clearing the stage and defeating the boss, the [[Links]] receive a Key from the [[Great Fairy]]. The key received depends on how many [[Rupee]]s were collected. The boss of Death Mountain is a flame monster called [[Gouen]], and the symbol is the [[Fire Element]].

==={{FSA|-}}===
In {{FSA}}, Death Mountain appears as an area of Hyrule and as the third [[Levels in Four Swords Adventures|Level]]. It consists of three Stages: [[Death Mountain Foothills]], [[The Mountain Path]], and [[Tower of Flames]].

==={{TP|-}}===
[[File:Death Mountain Trail TP.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Death Mountain from {{TP|-}}]]
In {{TP}}, Death Mountain is also home to the Goron tribe. Due to its volcanic nature, the mountain also boasts steam jets and mineral-rich [[Hot Spring]]s. Death Mountain experiences frequent eruptions early in the game due to events related to the [[Twilight]].

Sticking to the Gorons' reputation as skilled metalsmiths, metal structures have been erected around the face of the mountain to provide access to areas which are otherwise unreachable. The Gorons themselves can give each other and Link a leg-up to unscalable surfaces. The Gorons also have a mine inside the volcanic interior of the mountain, where materials are mined and transported with the assistance of magnetic cranes. The mine is also home to [[Torch Slug]]s and [[Dodongo]]s.

When Link first tries to climb up Death Mountain, the Gorons attack him on sight due to an order from the Goron Elder, [[Gor Coron]].<ref>{{Cite|These lands ahead belong to the Goron tribe! The elder said no humans may pass!|Goron|TP}}</ref> To successfully ascend the mountain, Link must use the [[Iron Boots]] to avoid being knocked down by the Gorons' roll attack and thus be able to stop them in their tracks. Link eventually reaches the main area of Death Mountain, where a giant rock from the mountain's volcano falls. After successfully evading the Gorons and using them to launch himself higher up the mountain, Link enters the Gorons' home. There, he is informed by Gor Coron that he will not allow him to enter the [[Goron Mines]], which are sacred to the Gorons, unless he beats him in a match of [[sumo]].<ref>{{Cite|The mines beyond here are sacred to my tribe. Outsiders are not allowed. Unless... I could make an exception...but you would have to beat me in a contest of power. Are you willing to try that, little human?|Gor Coron|TP}}</ref> Successfully defeating the Goron Elder allows Link to enter the mines and obtain the second [[Fused Shadow]], saving [[Darbus]] and obtaining the Gorons' respect along the way.

==={{ALBW|-}}===
[[File:Weather Vane Death Mountain ALBW.png|right|thumb|300px|Hyrule's Death Mountain from {{ALBW|-}}]]
In {{ALBW}}, the volcano upon Death Mountain, Spectacle Rock, is active, which causes boulders to fall across the lower areas of the mountain. Spectacle Rock is now near the [[Tower of Hera (A Link Between Worlds)|Tower of Hera]]. As the Dark World is not present in {{ALBW|-}}, going through it is not necessary to reach the Tower of Hera. The cave system on the eastern side of Death Mountain is complex, containing several moving platforms that Link must fall on in order to reach the exits. One of the exits leads to [[Rosso's Ore Mine]], which contains a portal to [[Lorule]].

Lorule has its own Death Mountain that is not an active volcano. It is covered in snow, thus many of the enemies adapted ice-themed powers. The cave system of Lorule's Death Mountain contains similar jumping puzzles in the eastern section. This version is split in half, with one half containing the [[Treacherous Tower]], and the other half containing the [[Ice Ruins]].

==={{BotW|-}}===
<!--Geography-->In {{BotW}}, Death Mountain is a an enormous volcanic mountain in eastern {{Term|BotW|Eldin (Region)|link}}. It is surrounded by a large moat of lava known as [[Death Caldera]], which flows into other parts of Eldin as rivers and forms smaller bodies of lava. The [[Bridge of Eldin]] is the only means of crossing the moat.

<!--Gameplay-->Death Mountain has a higher temperature than the rest of Eldin, requiring Link to possess two levels of [[Flame Guard]] in order to explore the Mountain without being lit aflame and taking damage. Link can acquire enough Flame Guard either by wearing at least two pieces of [[Flamebreaker Armor]] or wearing one piece and using a [[Fireproof Elixir]].

<!--Story-->The {{Term|BotW|Divine Beast Vah Rudania|link}} walks along the side of Death Mountain, causing its eruptions to worsen.<ref>{{Cite|With {{Color|BotW Blue|Rudania}} runnin' wild recently, Death Mountain's eruptions have gotten real bad.|Bludo|BotW}}</ref> [[Bludo]] of the Gorons, along with [[Yunobo]]'s help, use [[Cannon]]s stationed at the mountain to drive away Vah Rudania, but it always returns.<ref>{{Cite|He uses it to protect himself when he fire him at {{Color|BotW Blue|Rudania}}. That's the only way we can chase that blasted beast away.|Bludo|BotW}}</ref> Bludo had also raised the Bridge of Eldin to prevent Vah Rudania from crossing over, thereby making the Bridge and Death Mountain inaccessible until Link progresses in the "{{Term|BotW|Divine Beast Vah Rudania (Quest)|link}}" {{Term|BotW|Main Quest|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|The problem is...good ol' Boss raised the {{Color|BotW Red|Bridge of Eldin}} to make sure that mean Divine Beast couldn't get over here.|Yunobo|BotW}}</ref> After Link defeats {{Term|BotW|Fireblight Ganon|link}} and frees Vah Rudania, the {{Term|BotW|Divine Beast|link}} climbs to the [[Death Mountain Summit]], where it takes aim at {{Term|BotW|Hyrule Castle|link}}.

<!--Music-->The music heard at Death Mountain has the same melody as the music that plays in Level-9 of the first {{TLoZ|-}} game. This is a reference to Level-9 being found within the original Death Mountain.

Sahasrahla warns that the power of the [[Dark World]] turns the inhabitants into a reflection of their heart, and Link's hatred of Agahnim would turn him into a beast if he were to enter.<ref>{{Cite Book|quote= You penetrated the gate to the Dark World...

==Trivia==
*In {{FPTRR}}, a mountain called [[Mount Desma]] might be a reference to Death Mountain, as it is written that Mount Desma is "the Mountain of Death" in one of the [[Yamatami]] tribe's ancient books. Comparison of the Japanese names further suggests this. "Yama" is the Japanese word for "mountain," whereas "Desuma" differs only one Japanese letter from "Desu," or death.
* Perhaps a mistranslation, but the Light World version in the Japanese version (known as Mount Hebra) was labeled as Death Mountain during the end credits. This could explain why the localization accepted the location as Death Mountain despite being  referred to the Dark World counterpart.

==Nomenclature==
In the Japanese version of {{ALttP|-}} and {{ALBW|-}}, the mountain is only named Death Mountain in the Dark World. In the Light World, it is known as {{Romanize|ヘブラ山|Hebura Yama|Mount Hebra|2}}.
