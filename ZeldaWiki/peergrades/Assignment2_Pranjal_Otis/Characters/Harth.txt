==Biography==
{{Term|BotW|Harth}} is {{Term|BotW|Rito Village|link}}'s {{Term|BotW|Bow|link}} craftsman.<ref>{{Cite|I am Harth. Bow craft is my trade.|Harth|BotW}}</ref> He is able to craft quality {{Plural|BotW|Bow}} for {{Term|BotW|Rito|link}} warriors in the {{Term|BotW|Rito Village|display=Village}}, including the {{Term|BotW|Great Eagle Bow|link}}, the signature {{Term|BotW|Bow}} once used by the {{Term|BotW|Rito}} {{Term|BotW|Champion|link}}, {{Term|BotW|Revali|link}}. He is {{Term|BotW|Teba|link}}'s childhood friend.<ref>{{Cite Book|quote= |book= CaC |publisher= |page= 400}}</ref>

{{Term|BotW|Harth}} is found at his home holding his hurt arm, claiming that the {{Term|BotW|Divine Beast Vah Medoh|link}} had attacked him while he was assisting {{Term|BotW|Teba}}. Despite {{Term|BotW|Link|link}}'s concern, he tells him that it is not his business or place to worry about and stays in his home to recover.

After {{Term|BotW|Divine Beast Vah Medoh|display=Medoh}} has been freed from {{Term|BotW|Calamity Ganon|link}}'s corruption, {{Term|BotW|Harth}} is willing to do {{Term|BotW|Link}} the service of crafting him a new {{Term|BotW|Great Eagle Bow}}, should he ever lose or break the one he receives from the {{Term|BotW|Rito}} Elder, {{Term|BotW|Kaneli|link}}. If needed, {{Term|BotW|Harth}} will ask {{Term|BotW|Link}} to bring him a {{Term|BotW|Swallow Bow|link}}, five bundles of {{Term|BotW|Wood|link}}, and a {{Term|BotW|Diamond|link}} in order to craft a new one.
