{{Term/Store|Hateno Village||Series, BotW}} is a location in {{BotW}}.

==Features and Overview==
Hateno Village is a permanent [[Hylian]] settlement located in [[East Necluda]]. It is rumored to be the hometown of [[Link]].<ref>{{Cite Book|quote= |book= CaC |publisher= |page= 376}}</ref> Since the destruction of the Kingdom of [[Hyrule]] by [[Calamity Ganon]], Hateno is the larger of only two Hylian permanent settlements that survived after the [[Great Calamity]]. The survival of Hateno Village is owed largely to the successful defense effort at [[Fort Hateno]].

The [[Myahm Agana Shrine]] is located in the Village and the [[Hateno Ancient Tech Lab]] overlooks the Village from a large hill to the east. The peaceful Village contains an Inn and a few shops, including the [[East Wind]] [[General Store]], an [[Armor Shop]] and the [[Dye Shop]]. The environment is decorated by two large working windmills,<ref>{{Cite|I'm watching the windmills. They have to maintain a steady speed or the consistency of the flour will be off.|Rhodes|BotW}}</ref> several [[Blue Flame]] lamps and several [[Apple]] [[Tree]]s.
