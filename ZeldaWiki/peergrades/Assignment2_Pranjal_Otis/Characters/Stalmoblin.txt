{{Term/Store|Stalmoblin|Stalmoblins|Series, BotW|plural}} are recurring {{Plural|Series|Enemy|link}} in {{TLoZ|Series}}.<ref>{{Cite|'''{{Color|BotW Shrine Quest|Stalmoblin}}'''|Hyrule Compendium|BotW}}</ref>{{Name Ref|HWAoC}}

==Characteristics==
==={{BotW|-}}===
{{Compendium/Extract|Stalmoblin}}
Stalmoblins are the skeletal remains of [[Moblin]]s which emerge from the ground at night.<ref>{{Cite|The remains of Moblins appear in the dark of the night.|Hyrule Compendium|BotW}}</ref> They may have various {{Plural|BotW|Weapon|link}} equipped. If they do not carry any Weapons, they will swing at [[Link]]. Like other Stal enemies, their bones are very fragile and any attack Link hits them with will cause them to temporarily fall apart.<ref>{{Cite|Even the toughest Moblins become fragile when they're little more than a pile of bones, so they'll crumble after just a few attacks.|Hyrule Compendium|BotW}}</ref> The bones rebuild themselves without the head after a short period of time and walk toward the head as the head hops and rolls to the body so that they can rejoin.<ref>{{Cite|However, as long as a skull remains intact, they'll continue to pull themselves back together and go on fighting.|Hyrule Compendium|BotW}}</ref> After being broken apart, Link can pick up its [[Moblin Arm]] and use it as a Weapon. If Link destroys the head before the monster rebuilds itself, it is permanently defeated and both the body and head will vanish. When defeated, they drop [[Moblin Fang]]s and [[Moblin Horn]]s.

If Link wears the [[Moblin Mask]], [[Majora's Mask (Item)|Majora's Mask]], or possesses the [[Disguise; Bone Atk. Up]] [[Set Bonus]] by wearing the full [[Radiant Set]] or [[Phantom Ganon Set]], Stalmoblins will not attack Link unless he attacks them.

==Other Appearances==
{{Noncanon|Start}}
=== {{HWAoC|-}} ===
{{Stub}}
Stalmoblins reappear/retroactively debut in {{HWAoC}}, first appearing in [[Freeing Korok Forest]]. They attack the same way as their living counterparts, though they cannot continue the fight as [[Cursed Moblin]]s.
