==Biography==
Maca is a [[Korok]] that lives in the [[Korok Forest]].  Maca can be found outside the entrance of the [[Great Deku Tree]], and provides [[Link]] with information about the forest and [[Master Sword]].  Maca tells Link that the Master Sword may lose power if overused, but will regenerate over time.<ref>{{Cite|Well the {{Color|BotW Blue|Master Sword}} is a very special weapon, but it can lose its power if you overuse it.<br>When that happens, don't panic. All you have to do is wait for its power to regenerate.|Maca|BotW}}</ref> When Link asks about leaving the forest, Maca questions why he would want to leave this perfect place.<ref>{{Cite|You want to leave the forest? But why? It's perfect here!|Maca|BotW}}</ref> Regardless, Maca tells Link that he can leave the woods by warping through the mouth of an Ogre Tree east from the sword pedestal.<ref>{{Cite|If you head east from the {{Color|BotW Red|sword pedestal}}, there will be a sign on your right. Climb up the hill on the right side of the sign, and you'll see an {{Color|BotW Red|ogre tree}}. If you walk into that tree's mouth, you'll *whoosh* be taken to the entrance of the woods.|Maca|BotW}}</ref>

==Trivia==
*Maca's leaf mask and appearance resemble [[Hollo]] from {{TWW}}.
