The {{Term/Store|Divine Beast Vah Ruta||Series, BotW}} (pronounced {{IPA|ˈruː.tə}} {{respell|ROO|tə}})<ref>{{Cite web|quote= And Ruta, as well.|published= March 4, 2017|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzNek4MfK5M?t=1360|title= Zelda Breath of the Wild - All Cutscenes The Movie HD|site= YouTube}}</ref> is a [[Divine Beast]] and a dungeon in {{BotW}}. It is a giant machine that resembles an elephant.

==History==
One hundred years before the events of {{BotW|-}}, Ruta was piloted by [[Mipha]], the [[Zora]] [[Champion]]. After [[Calamity Ganon]] took control of it, it created a torrential downpour in the [[Lanayru Great Spring]]. If [[Link]] approaches it before defeating [[Waterblight Ganon]], he will be thrown backwards by its barrier.

==Entrance to the Divine Beast==
Before Link can board Ruta, he must team up with [[Sidon]] to disable it. Link must disable the switches on Ruta's sides by swimming up waterfalls and shooting them with [[Shock Arrow]]s. Each time Link disables a switch, Ruta launches an increasingly savage volley of ice blocks and spheres towards the duo, which Link must break in order to progress. Once he has deactivated all the switches, the endless rain around Zora's Domain ceases and the machine becomes accessible.

==Themes and Navigation==
Once inside, Link can control Ruta's trunk and move it between various positions. It constantly spews water, allowing Link to position the stream of water by extension. In order to calm Ruta, Link must activate each of the five terminals located throughout it with his [[Sheikah Slate]]. After Link activates them all, he can proceed to fight [[Waterblight Ganon]].

Upon defeating Waterblight Ganon, Link is visited by Mipha's spirit and receives [[Mipha's Grace]], a magical power similar to that of a [[Fairy]]. He is also rewarded with Mipha's [[Lightscale Trident]] by [[Muzu]]. Ruta, now commanded by Mipha's spirit, climbs atop a cliff and targets [[Hyrule Castle]] in preparation of Link's fight against Ganon.
