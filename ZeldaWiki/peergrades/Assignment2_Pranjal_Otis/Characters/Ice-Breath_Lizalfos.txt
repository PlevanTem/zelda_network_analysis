{{Compendium/Extract|Ice-Breath Lizalfos}}
Ice-Breath Lizalfos are one of the elemental variants of [[Lizalfos]]. They can spit out balls of [[Ice]] that break into bursts of cold air when they make contact with the ground.<ref name="Compendium">{{Cite|The balls of ice they spit make them particularly troublesome, but exposure to fire will kill them instantly.|Hyrule Compendium|BotW}}</ref> They have a moderate amount of health at 288. Hitting an Ice-Breath Lizalfos with a [[Fire]] attack, such as with [[Fire Arrow]]s or a [[Flameblade]], evaporates it instantly.<ref name="Compendium"/> They are mostly found in snowy areas, such as the northern [[Gerudo Highlands]] and the [[Hebra Mountains]]. When defeated, they may drop [[Lizalfos Horn]]s, [[Lizalfos Talon]]s, and [[Icy Lizalfos Tail]]s.
