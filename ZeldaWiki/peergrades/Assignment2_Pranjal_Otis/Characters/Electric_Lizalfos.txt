==Characteristics==

{{Compendium/Extract|Electric Lizalfos}}
Electric Lizalfos are one of the elemental varieties of [[Lizalfos]]. They emit strong electrical currents from their bodies,<ref>{{Cite|They can emit strong electrical currents from their bodies, so don't get too close.|Hyrule Compendium|BotW}}</ref> therefore, they can create arcs of electricity which can cause [[Link]] to drop his weapons. Striking their horns with an [[Arrow]] causes an electric discharge.<ref>{{Cite|Their horns are brimming with electricity, which will discharge and arc to nearby areas if struck by an arrow.|Hyrule Compendium|BotW}}</ref> Like all Lizalfos, Electric Lizalfos will not attack {{Term|BotW|Link|link}} if he is wearing the [[Lizalfos Mask]].
