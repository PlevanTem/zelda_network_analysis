==Features and Overview==
Eldin Canyon is a vast area within [[Eldin (Region)|Eldin]], comprising of almost the entirety of the Region. The Canyon primarily covers southern and central Eldin, and stretches to the far northeast along the ends of [[Hyrule]]. The southern portion of the Canyon is a valley with rolling foothills that borders along [[Great Hyrule Forest]], [[Hyrule Field]], and northern [[Lanayru (Region)|Lanayru]]. A road paves through this section before forking between Eldin proper and Lanayru. This winding road then leads to the [[Foothill Stable]] before continuing into central Eldin. The valley is initially even and partially wooded, especially toward the west, however, further north it increasingly turns more rugged and mountainous closer to central Eldin.

The central portion of Eldin Canyon has harder terrain with steep cliffs and deep gorges. Further to the north and closer to [[Death Mountain]], the landscape turns more perilous due to the area's high volcanic activity. Eruptions caused by Death Mountain have formed multiple bodies and rivers of lava around the area, as such as [[Darunia Lake]] and the moat that surrounds Death Mountain. Due to the intense climate, the [[Temperature]] grows exceedingly hot here, and puts Link in danger of catching fire along with any wooden Gear that is equipped. The high Temperature can be remedied either by consuming [[Food#Breath of the Wild|Food]] or an [[Food|Elixir]] that grants fire resistance, or by wearing any one of the [[Flamebreaker Set]]. The road that paves through central Eldin Canyon eventually leads to [[Goron City]], the home of the [[Goron]]s, before continuing to the [[Abandoned North Mine]] and finally Death Mountain.

The northernmost portion gives way to a mountainous, barren wasteland that has little to no substance. This area borders along the very edge of Hyrule as a steep, bottomless cliff known as [[Eldin's Flank]]. Eldin Canyon shares much of this landscape with the [[Eldin Mountains]] to the west.

Throughout Eldin Canyon, a number of bodies of water close to Death Mountain are [[Hot Spring]]s, and will gradually recover Link's health as he stands or swims in them.
