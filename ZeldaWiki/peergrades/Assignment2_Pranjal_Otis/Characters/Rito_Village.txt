==Features and Overview==
The Rito Village is the home of the [[Rito]] that is located in the middle of [[Lake Totori]] in the [[Tabantha Frontier]]. It is led by an elderly Rito chieftain named [[Kaneli]] and was home to the Rito [[Champion]], [[Revali]]. The {{Term|BotW|Divine Beast Vah Medoh|link}}, which is under the influence of [[Calamity Ganon]]'s control, can be seen circling around the Village. Medoh attacks any Rito who flies into its range, making it too dangerous for them to leave the Village.{{Fact}} After [[Link]] calms Medoh, the [[Divine Beast]] perches itself on top of Rito Village and aims its sights toward [[Hyrule Castle (Breath of the Wild)|Hyrule Castle]]. Rito Village contains [[Akh Va'quot Shrine]].
