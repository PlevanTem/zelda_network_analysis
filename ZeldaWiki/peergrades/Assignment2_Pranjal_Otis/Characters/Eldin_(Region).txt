{{Term/Store|Eldin||Series, BotW, HWAoC}} is a recurring {{Term|Series|Region|link}} in {{TLoZ|series}}.<ref>{{Cite|'''{{Big|Eldin}}'''|Map|BotW}}</ref>{{Name Ref|HWAoC}}

==Features and Overview==
==={{BotW|-}}===
Eldin is a vast Region in northern [[Hyrule]]. The Region is split into two distinct halves. The eastern side is a largely mountainous stretch of land that consists densely of foothills, deep gorges, and volcanic activity.<ref>{{Cite|{{Color|BotW Blue|Eldin}} is northeast of here. It's a mountainous region with {{Color|BotW Blue|Death Mountain}} at its center.|Ashe|BotW}}</ref> It consists of two areas: [[Eldin Canyon]] and [[Death Mountain]]. The [[Eldin Mountains]] run north of Eldin Canyon and west into northern {{Term|BotW|Central Hyrule|link}}. The Eldin Canyon is the largest of all these areas, covering almost the entirety of southern and eastern Eldin.

The Eldin Region initially starts off as a partially wooded and even road furthest to the south. Further to the northeast and closer to Death Mountain, the land increasingly grows more perilous with harder terrain and volcanic activity. As [[Link]] nears this area, the [[Temperature]] grows exceedingly hot and causes Link and any wooden Gear equipped to catch on fire. Link can withstand the high Temperatures by consuming [[Food#Breath of the Wild|Food]] or [[Food|Elixir]]s that grant Flame Guard, or by wearing any of the [[Flamebreaker Set]], allowing him to safely travel through the hotter climate. Some areas such as Death Mountain and the [[Abandoned North Mine]], are even hotter and require Link to either wear at least two Flamebreaker pieces, or to wear one and consume a Flame Guard Food. The northernmost area of Eldin is a barren, dead wasteland that sits along the ends of Hyrule. This area extends to the northwest through the Eldin Mountains.

Due to its hotter climate, eastern Eldin hosts a number of [[Hot Spring]]s that will gradually recover Link's health as he swims through them. Certain items will begin to burn as they are placed on the ground in the Region's volcanic areas as well. Through this, it is possible to [[Cooking|grill]] certain Food.<ref>{{Cite|I'll tell ya somethin' interesting... Goron City is so hot, if ya put anything on the ground, it'll cook up in no time. Once people figured that out, we lost all our customers. All of 'em!|Aji|BotW}}</ref> As very few people can naturally withstand the intense heat without the aid of Food or Armor, eastern Eldin is home almost exclusively to the [[Goron]] Tribe, who live in [[Goron City]] in east-central Eldin. [[Creature]]s well adapted to the climate, such as [[Fireproof Lizard]]s, [[Hotfeather Pigeon]]s, and [[Eldin Ostrich]]es, also inhabit the Region throughout.

Eldin is also a major resource of [[Gem]]s which are found inside [[Ore Deposit]]s,<ref>{{Cite|So I've decided to open up shop! I'm not sure why we have so much ore here, but maybe it's because we're close to {{Color|BotW Blue|Death Mountain}}.|Pelison|BotW}}</ref> and also has a high abundance of [[Luminous Stone Deposit]]s.

During present events, eastern Eldin is plagued by the {{Term|BotW|Divine Beast Vah Rudania|link}}. As Link enters the Region to quell Vah Rudania from [[Calamity Ganon]]'s influence, he eventually meets the Gorons [[Bludo]] and [[Yunobo]] as part of the "[[Divine Beast Vah Rudania (Quest)|Divine Beast Vah Rudania]]" [[Main Quest]]. Link and Yunobo band together to scale Death Mountain to weaken the Divine Beast, allowing Link to board it and regain control of Vah Rudania after defeating [[Fireblight Ganon]].

====Death Mountain====
{{Main|Death Mountain}}
'''Death Mountain''' is the largest mountain in Eldin. Its eruptions are responsible for the Region's high volcanic activity. The Divine Beast Vah Rudania crawls along its rockface during present events. Death Mountain is surrounded by a moat of lava it feeds into, which can only be crossed by using the [[Bridge of Eldin]].

A number of signs along the main road through eastern Eldin guide the way to [[Death Mountain Summit]], by denoting certain areas as a Death Mountain Marker. The first of these signs begins shortly before the [[Maw of Death Mountain]] and ends at the final sign atop Death Mountain Summit.

====Eldin Canyon====
{{Main|Eldin Canyon}}
'''Eldin Canyon''' is the most expansive area of eastern Eldin. It covers the majority of the Region, extending from southern and central Eldin proper to the northeast. The southern portion consists of the Region's base, and is mainly a mountainous valley with deep gorges and rugged slopes. This portion serves as the main entrance to eastern Eldin, via the road that paves between [[Central Hyrule]] and northern [[Lanayru (Region)|Lanayru]]. The central portion has prevalent volcanic activity with pools and rivers of lava formed by Death Mountain's eruptions. The northernmost portion is a barren, mountainous wasteland devoid of life, which is shared with the Eldin Mountains.

====Eldin Mountains====
{{Main|Eldin Mountains}}
The '''Eldin Mountains''' are a mountain range in northwestern Eldin. It stretches westward from Eldin into northern Central Hyrule toward the {{Term|BotW|Hebra|link}} {{Term|BotW|Region}}. The area closest to east Eldin is primarily a barren wasteland, consisting of dead trees and scattered skeletal remains. The area gradually grows more abundant in vegetation further to the west and closer to Central Hyrule and the Great Hyrule Forest.
