==Biography==
Cima is a {{Term|BotW|Hylian|link}} worker at {{Term|BotW|Lakeside Stable|link}} in {{Term|BotW|West Necluda|link}}. She tends to the {{Plural|BotW|Horse|link}} that reside at the {{Term|BotW|Stable|link}} during the day. At night, she sleeps in one of the Stable's beds.<ref>{{Cite|Zzz...|Cima|BotW}}</ref>

When {{Term|BotW|Link|link}} first speaks to Cima, she complains about how nervous {{Term|BotW|Lightning|link}} makes her when it strikes the Stable.<ref>{{Cite|Oh dear, oh dear... {{Color|BotW Red|Lightning}} strikes this stable so often, I get nervous whenever it rains even a little.|Cima|BotW}}</ref> She asks Link to figure out when the Stable is struck so often.<ref>{{Cite|I just don't understand why it strikes so often... Hey, it's a long shot, but if you have some time, could you find out why?|Cima|BotW}}</ref> Cima will be happy if he accepts,<ref>{{Cite|You will?! Really? I'm so happy! I'm counting on you.|Cima|BotW}}</ref> which initiates the "{{Term|BotW|Thunder Magnet|link}}" {{Term|BotW|Side Quest|link}}.

On top of the Stable, Link can find a {{Term|BotW|Woodcutter's Axe|link}}. After taking the Axe, Link can return to Cima to inform her.<ref>{{Cite|What? You found out what was drawing the {{Color|BotW Red|lightning}} here?|Cima|BotW}}</ref> She realizes that the Axe must have been drawing the Lightning to the Stable and wonders if it was put up there on purpose.<ref>{{Cite|Aha! Yeah, that's as good as a lightning rod, isn't it? I wonder if someone put it up there on purpose. How strange...|Cima|BotW}}</ref> She thanks Link for his help, giving him a {{Term|BotW|Rubber Helm|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|Thanks for looking into it for me! Here's something for your trouble.|Cima|BotW}}</ref> Cima is relieved to finally be able to relax.<ref>{{Cite|I can finally relax!|Cima|BotW}}</ref> This completes the Side Quest.

Cima will ask Link if he's seen the {{Plural|BotW|Waterfall|link}} leading into {{Term|BotW|Lake Floria|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|Did you check out the falls at Lake Floria? There are 10 different falls there, big and small!|Cima|BotW}}</ref> She claims each one is unique and worth seeing.<ref>{{Cite|Each one is unique and absolutely worth a look.|Cima|BotW}}</ref> While she's going to sleep, she tells Link to wait for whatever he needs until tomorrow.<ref>{{Cite|Did you need something? Well, I'm going to sleep now. See you tomorrow.|Cima|BotW}}</ref>
