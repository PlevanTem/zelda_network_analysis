==Biography==
Chio is a {{Term|BotW|Korok|link}} that can be found underneath the {{Term|BotW|Great Deku Tree|link}} in the {{Term|BotW|Korok Forest|link}}. When {{Term|BotW|Link|link}} first speaks to him, Chio recognizes him as the hero.<ref>{{Cite|Huh? You... Could it be?! You're Mr. Hero! Mr. Hero is here!|Chio|BotW}}</ref> He explains to Link that the mushroom on his head suddenly sprouted that day, so he had expected something to happen.<ref>{{Cite|The mushroom on my head suddenly sprouted today, so I knew something was up! It was a prediction that you'd come! ...I think.|Chio|BotW}}</ref>

Chio reveals that the Koroks all prepared some trials for Link.<ref>{{Cite|Us Koroks all got together and prepared some {{Color|BotW Red|trials}} just for you, Mr. Hero!|Chio|BotW}}</ref> If Link hasn't yet pulled out the {{Term|BotW|Master Sword|link}}, Chio says the trials will help him do so.<ref>{{Cite|If you pass the veeeery tough {{Color|BotW Red|trials}} we've prepared... pulling out the {{Color|BotW Blue|Master Sword}} will be a piece of cake! ...Probably!|Chio|BotW}}</ref> However, if Link already has the Master Sword, Chio is unsure whether he'll need them.<ref>{{Cite|Although you may not need them, since you already pulled the {{Color|BotW Blue|Master Sword}} out and all... But these {{Color|BotW Red|trials}} will help you grow even stronger than you are now!|Chio|BotW}}</ref> He goes on to tell Link that he designed an extra-tough trial himself, as the elder of Korok Forest.<ref>{{Cite|Among the {{Color|BotW Red|trials}} is an extra-tough one designed by me, the elder of {{Color|BotW Blue|Korok Forest}}.|Chio|BotW}}</ref> He asks Link if he's ready to test his mettle,<ref>{{Cite|So will you test your mettle in the {{Color|BotW Red|Korok Trials}}?|Chio|BotW}}</ref> and accepting his challenge initiates the {{Term|BotW|Side Quest|link}} "{{Term|BotW|The Korok Trials|link}}".

When Link asks, Chio informs him on what the {{Term|BotW|Korok Trials|link}} are before he gets started.<ref>{{Cite|[Korok Trials?] Ah, you need to think about it first... Wise boy...|Chio|BotW}}</ref> He explains that the goal is to visit all of the {{Plural|BotW|Ancient Shrine|link}} in the Korok Forest to be considered a grown-up.<ref>{{Cite|The {{Color|BotW Red|Korok Trials}}! Long story shortâ€”you need to visit all the shrines in the Korok Forest so that you can be considered {{Color|BotW Red|a real grown-up}}!|Chio|BotW}}</ref> According to him, it is a ceremony that every Korok must undertake, based on Link's own trials.<ref>{{Cite|It's a ceremony that every Korok must undertake, and it's based on the trials of the legendary hero himself!|Chio|BotW}}</ref> Chio and {{Term|BotW|Hestu|link}} have both participated.<ref>{{Cite|I've done it... and so has Hestu... and him over there, and her too, and even the Great Deku Tree himself has done it! OK... that last part was a lie. He's pretty rooted.|Chio|BotW}}</ref>

The first trial that Chio shares is the "{{Term|BotW|Trial of Second Sight|link}}", which is found in the southwest of Korok Forest.<ref>{{Cite|{{Big|Trial one!}} In the southwest forest: {{Color|BotW Red|Trial of Second Sight}}!|Chio|BotW}}</ref> He then shares the location of the second trial, "{{Term|BotW|The Lost Pilgrimage|link}}", in the northwest Forest.<ref>{{Cite|{{Big|Trial two!}} In the northwest forest: {{Color|BotW Red|The Lost Pilgrimage}}!|Chio|BotW}}</ref> Finally, he tells Link the third trial, "{{Term|BotW|The Test of Wood|link}}" in the eastern Forest.<ref>{{Cite|{{Big|Trial three!}} In the eastern forest: {{Color|BotW Red|The Test of Wood}}!|Chio|BotW}}</ref> He reiterates that overcoming the Korok Trials means one can overcome anything.<ref>{{Cite|If you can overcome the Korok Trials, you can overcome anything!|Chio|BotW}}</ref> The Koroks have also prepared prizes for Link when he completes the Trials.<ref>{{Cite|We've also prepared some wonderful prizes for you! Now show us what you're made of!|Chio|BotW}}</ref>

Once Link completes all of the Trials,<ref>{{Cite|What?! You've finished all of the {{Color|BotW Red|trials}}?|Chio|BotW}}</ref> Chio will be impressed.<ref>{{Cite|*whistle*<br>That's amazing! You're so cool!|Chio|BotW}}</ref> Recognizing that Link wants a reward,<ref>{{Cite|Ah! I know that look. You want me to give you something since you visited all the places, don't you?|Chio|BotW}}</ref> Chio has no choice but to give Link his most treasured item, three {{Plural|BotW|Big Hearty Truffle|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|...I guess I have no choice. I'll give you my treasured item.|Chio|BotW}}</ref> He suggests eating a dish made with Big Hearty Truffles as it will soothe all of his pain.<ref>{{Cite|Try eating a dish cooked with that {{Color|BotW Blue|big hearty truffle}}... It'll soothe all of your aches and pains and then some! I'm not pulling your branch here! Just try it for yourself!|Chio|BotW}}</ref> This completes the Side Quest.

Chio feels very privileged to have witnessed Link pulling out the Master Sword.<ref>{{Cite|I was privileged enough to witness you pull out the Master Sword!|Chio|BotW}}</ref> Without anymore Trials for Link, he encourages Link to go and save {{Term|BotW|Hyrule Kingdom|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|I have no more trials to give you! Go! Restore peace to Hyrule!|Chio|BotW}}</ref> The Koroks will be cheering for him from the Forests.<ref>{{Cite|Now go!<br>We will be cheering you on from the depths of the forest!|Chio|BotW}}</ref>

==Trivia==
*Aside from Hestu, Chio is the only Korok appearing in {{BotW|-}} to have an entirely new character design, rather than one based on a Korok from {{TWW}}. He is also the only Korok, aside from Hestu, to have a unique character design not shared with any other Korok in the game.
