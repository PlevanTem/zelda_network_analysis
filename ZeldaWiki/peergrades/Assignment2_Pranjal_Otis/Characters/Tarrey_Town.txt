{{Term/Store|Tarrey Town||Series, BotW}} is a location in {{BotW}}.

==Features and Overview==
Tarrey Town is an initially-uninhabited circular rocky island in the middle of the northern section of [[Lake Akkala]] in the [[Akkala Highlands]], connected to the mainland only by a rock arch functioning as a bridge. The only point of interest at this point in time is a lone [[Goddess Statue]] in the center.

After [[Link]] purchases [[Link's House|an abandoned house]] in [[Hateno Village]] from [[Bolson]] in the "[[Hylian Homeowner]]" [[Side Quest]], Bolson sends the veteran carpenter, [[Hudson]], to Lake Akkala to clear land as part of a business expansion for [[Bolson Construction]].<ref>{{Cite|Thanks for the sweet investment. Spending so much money on ANYTHING at your age... It's just so...studly! There's a {{Color|BotW Blue|weapon mount}} in there that never sold... Consider it a housewarming gift. Hope you get some use out of it. So...next-job time, baby! What'd I have lined up again? Oh, yeah, {{Color|BotW Red|that's}} what's next. I was going to send Hudson up {{Color|BotW Blue|Akkala}} way to clear some land!|Bolson|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Yup... Business expansion, y'know. I'll probably have him head out soon. If you want to say anything to Hudson, better catch him before he leaves.|Bolson|BotW}}</ref> Once Link wishes Hudson good luck, Hudson will  begin the long journey to the [[Akkala]] Region, which begins the "[[From the Ground Up]]" Side Quest. If Link visits Hudson on the small island, Hudson will reveal he plans to build a village from the ground up and that he has named it Tarrey Town.<ref>{{Cite|Since I've been transferred here, I've decided to build a village from scratch. Every village needs a name, though. I think I'll call it...{{Color|BotW Blue|Tarrey Town}}.|Hudson|BotW}}</ref> However, with only a house built to store the supplies, Hudson feels there isn't enough in the Town.<ref>{{Cite|I built a house to store the village supplies in, but there just isn't enough...|Hudson|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|[Enough what?] Enough anything... People... Money... Stuff...|Hudson|BotW}}</ref> If Link decides to help Hudson, Hudson will first ask for more bundles of [[Wood]] to build another house.<ref>{{Cite|Well...I suppose to get started, we'll need houses for people to live in. We can't invite them until we have homes. Do you think you can bring me {{Color|BotW Red|10 bundles of wood}}?|Hudson|BotW}}</ref> Over the course of the Side Quest, Hudson will ask for Link to recruit new employees into Bolson Construction to assist with preparing and operating the town. Due to Bolson Construction policy, all new employees must have names that end with "-son".<ref>{{Cite|Yeah, in accordance with the official {{Color|BotW Blue|Bolson Construction}} policy, that someone's name must end in "son." If you run into anyone that fits with what I've said, send them here to {{Color|BotW Blue|Tarrey Town}} for me.|Hudson|BotW}}</ref>
* [[Greyson]] and [[Pelison]], [[Goron]] brothers from the [[Southern Mine]] in the [[Eldin Canyon]], are the first new employees to join.  Greyson mines precious [[ore]]s and helps clear the surface of the Tarrey Town of rocks, while his younger brother Pelison operates a [[store]] selling the ores.
* [[Rhondson]], a [[Gerudo]] woman from the [[Kara Kara Bazaar]] in the [[Gerudo Desert]], is the third employee to join. She is a seamstress who makes and sells the [[Desert Voe Set]].
* [[Fyson]], a [[Rito]] from [[Rito Village]] in the [[Tabantha Frontier]], is the fourth employee to join. He operates Tarrey Town's general store.
* {{Term|BotW|Kapson|link}}, a [[Zora]] priest from [[Zora's Domain]], is the fifth employee to join. In addition to operating the [[Inn]], he is also granted the authority to officiate marriages between Bolson Construction employees as long as they name all their children names that end with "-son".
Non-employees [[Grant√©]], {{Term|BotW|Hagie|link}}, {{Term|BotW|Hunnie|link}}, {{Term|BotW|Moggs|link}}, [[Monari]] and {{Term|BotW|Ruli|link}} also move to Tarrey Town. [[Bolson]] and [[Karson]] of Bolson Construction do not move to Tarrey Town, but visit for Hudson's wedding to Rhondson before returning to Hateno.

When the town is complete, it contains six houses, all built in Bolson Construction's signature style of brightly-colorful cubic modules arranged and stacked to create different shapes of homes. All houses ring the central square in a hexagonal arrangement similarly to a cul-de-sac, with the backs of each house against the outer edge of the island. The center of the square has a fountain and the Goddess Statue is moved to the fountain's centerpiece.
