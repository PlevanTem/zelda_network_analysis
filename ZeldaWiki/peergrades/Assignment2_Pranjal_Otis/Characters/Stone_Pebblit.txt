{{Term/Store|Stone Pebblit|Stone Pebblits|Series, BotW|plural}} are {{Plural|BotW|Enemy}} in {{BotW}}.<ref>{{Cite|'''{{Color|BotW Shrine Quest|Stone Pebblit}}'''|Hyrule Compendium|BotW}}</ref>

==Characteristics==
{{Compendium/Extract|Stone Pebblit}}
{{Plural|BotW|Stone Pebblit}} are found all over {{Term|BotW|Hyrule Kingdom|link}}, though they are mainly located within groups of ordinary {{Plural|BotW|Rock|link}}, possibly in an attempt to catch {{Term|BotW|Link|link}} off guard. Their appearance changes based on the type of terrain that they hide in. When {{Term|BotW|Link}} gets close, they will rise out of the ground and move toward him, attempting to swipe at him with one arm. While ordinary {{Plural|BotW|Weapon|link}} will not work against them, they can easily be defeated by detonating {{Plural|BotW|Remote Bomb|link}}, or simply picking them up and tossing them away, at which point they will shatter. However, if held for too long, they will explode. This explosion does not deal damage to surrounding enemies, though it can harm {{Term|BotW|Link}} for a base amount of 16 points of damage.

The {{Term|BotW|Boulder Breaker|link}}, {{Plural|BotW|Cobble Crusher|link}}, {{Plural|BotW|Drillshaft|link}}, {{Plural|BotW|Iron Sledgehammer|link}}, {{Plural|BotW|Stone Smasher|link}}, and strikes from either {{Plural|BotW|Ancient Arrow|link}} or {{Plural|BotW|Bomb Arrow|link}} will instantly destroy {{Plural|BotW|Stone Pebblit}} regardless of damage dealt. {{Plural|BotW|Stone Pebblit}} will also instantly die if they are submerged in water. Once killed, each one will drop a single piece of a random {{Term|BotW|Ore|link}} or {{Term|BotW|Flint|link}}.

{{Plural|BotW|Stone Pebblit}} will slam their arms into {{Term|BotW|Link}} to attack, dealing 16 base damage.
