==Biography==
She is a traveling merchant that sells many cooking ingredients.  She travels a large range between [[Tabantha Bridge Stable]] and [[Serenne Stable]].  Since she has such a large traveling range, she can be found easier if setting the Sheikah Sensor to search for a [[Donkey]] or a [[Emblazoned Shield]], both of which she travels with.
