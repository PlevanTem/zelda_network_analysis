==Biography==
Marta is a [[Gerudo]] soldier who can be found in the barracks in [[Gerudo Town]]. If [[Link]] speaks to her, she talks about how [[Babi]]'s training is tough, but feels that she should not complain because of their failure to stop the [[Yiga Clan]] from stealing [[Riju]]'s [[Thunder Helm]].<ref>{{Cite|<nowiki>*</nowiki>pant pant* Babi's training is really tough, but... It's our fault the thieves were successful. We have no room to complain.|Marta|BotW}}</ref> If Link speaks to Marta after recovering the Thunder Helm, she is relieved that they can finally take a break.<ref>{{Cite|Thanks to you bringing back the chief's heirloom, we can finally take a break...|Marta|BotW}}</ref> However, she expresses concern that Babi has special training ready for them after they repair their spears.<ref>{{Cite|In theory, anyway. More likely, once we finish repairing our spears, we'll have to get started on more special training.|Marta|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|<small>*sigh* Babi's always got more special training...</small>|Marta|BotW}}</ref> Marta also feels that Babi is working too hard and hopes that she never becomes as intense as her.<ref>{{Cite|Babi is working way too hard, even though the chief's heirloom is back!|Marta|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|I hope I never become as intense as her...|Marta|BotW}}</ref>
