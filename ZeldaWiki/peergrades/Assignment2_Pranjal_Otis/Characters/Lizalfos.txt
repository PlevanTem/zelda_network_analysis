==Characteristics==
==={{OoT|-}}===
{{Navi|Lizalfos|'''Lizalfos''' <br>Use your shield well and fight with Z Targeting techniques!}}
{{Plural|OoT3D|Lizalfos}} brandish swords and have little armor in {{OoT}}. They are very agile, for they are able to jump far out of {{Term|OoT3D|Link|link}}'s attack range, as well as capable of leaping over the young hero's head to deliver a strike from behind. They first appear in {{Term|OoT3D|Dodongo's Cavern|link}}, where two pairs act as the {{Plural|OoT3D|Dungeon}}'s {{Plural|OoT3D|Sub-Boss|link}}. Despite having to face off against a duo, {{Term|OoT3D|Link}} does not have to fight both simultaneously. One engages the young hero, while the other watches from afar. Befitting their tendency to fight in pairs, after one {{Term|OoT3D|Lizalfos}} sustains enough damage, the two switch roles with one another. They are seldom encountered, only appearing as regular enemies later in the {{Term|OoT3D|Spirit Temple|link}} and in certain other {{Plural|OoT3D|Dungeon}} in {{MQ}}. A related enemy known as {{Plural|OoT3D|Dinolfos|link}} appear later in the game as well.

==={{TP|-}}===
{{Plural|TPHD|Lizalfos}} come in two varieties in {{TP}}. One variety uses an axe blade affixed to their tails, and the second variety makes use of a skull mask. They are easily defeated with {{Plural|TPHD|Bomb Arrow|link}} or {{Plural|TPHD|Hidden Skill|link}} such as the {{Term|TPHD|Back Slice|link}} and the {{Term|TPHD|Mortal Draw|link}}. In addition, {{Term|TPHD|Wolf Link|link}} is able to leap at and bite at their throats. {{Plural|TPHD|Lizalfos}} appear in parts of {{Term|TPHD|Hyrule Field|link}} in {{Term|TPHD|Lanayru Province|link}} in addition to numerous {{Plural|TPHD|Dungeon|link}}, including the {{Term|TPHD|Lakebed Temple|link}}, the {{Term|TPHD|Temple of Time (Dungeon)|link}}, the {{Term|TPHD|City in the Sky|link}}, {{Term|TPHD|Hyrule Castle|link}}, and the {{Term|TPHD|Cave of Ordeals|link}}.

{{Plural|TPHD|Dynalfos}}, similar but much larger and more heavily armored enemies, appear in the {{Term|TPHD|Temple of Time (Dungeon)}} and the {{Term|TPHD|City in the Sky}}. They are considerably more dangerous opponents than {{Plural|TPHD|Lizalfos}}, capable of dodging the {{Term|TPHD|Ending Blow|link}} and blocking many other attacks. A winged variety of {{Term|TPHD|Lizalfos}} called {{Plural|TPHD|Aeralfos|link}} also appear later in the game.{{Fact}}

==={{SS|-}}===
{{Fi|Lizalfos|This unmistakable monster is equipped with an arm guard made of hard iron. Great physical prowess makes it difficult to predict its movements. You will need to anticipate the direction of its arm guard to successfully land an attack on the exposed angle.}} 
{{Plural|SS|Lizalfos}} are first encountered in the {{Term|SS|Earth Temple|link}} as regular enemies in {{SS}}. They later appear as a pair also act as the {{Term|SS|Dungeon|link}}'s {{Term|SS|Sub-Boss|link}}, guarding the {{Term|SS|Bomb Bag|link}}. They adorn their forearms with large iron gauntlets that they can utilize in both their offense and defense. For example, the guard prevents them from being knocked over from normal attacks. Besides being adept defenders, {{Plural|SS|Lizalfos}} are very nimble and can swiftly dodge sword strikes, and they can harm {{Term|SS|Link}} by blowing streams of fire and by mashing him with the maces found on the tips of their tails. In addition to the {{Term|SS|Earth Temple}}, the saurian creatures can be found at the {{Term|SS|Lanayru Shipyard|link}}, the {{Term|SS|Pirate Stronghold|link}}, and the {{Term|SS|Volcano Summit|link}}. An efficient way to slay a {{Term|SS|Lizalfos}} is to use strong attacks that make them fall on the ground such as the {{Term|SS|Spin Attack|link}}. After this happens, {{Term|SS|Link}} can use the {{Term|SS|Fatal Blow|link}} to kill them. Defeating a {{Term|SS|Lizalfos}} will make it drop a {{Term|SS|Lizard Tail|link}}, which can be collected as {{Term|SS|Treasure|link}}.

A stronger variant known as {{Term|SS|Dark Lizalfos|link}} appear in the {{Term|SS|Fire Sanctuary (Dungeon)|link}} and {{Term|SS|Sky Keep|link}}.

==={{BotW|-}}===
{{Compendium/Extract|Lizalfos}}
{{Plural|BotW|Lizalfos}} appear as chameleon-like enemies in {{BotW}}. They will camouflage to their environment and wait for {{Term|BotW|Link|link}} to get near before ambushing him. There are several varieties of {{Term|BotW|Lizalfos}}, including {{Plural|BotW|Blue Lizalfos|link}}, {{Plural|BotW|Black Lizalfos|link}}, {{Plural|BotW|Silver Lizalfos|link}}, {{Plural|BotW|Fire-Breath Lizalfos|link}}, {{Plural|BotW|Ice-Breath Lizalfos|link}}, {{Plural|BotW|Electric Lizalfos|link}}, and in {{Term|BotW|Master Mode|link}}, {{Plural|BotW|Golden Lizalfos|link}}. They primarily use weapons of the {{Term|BotW|Lizalfos Gear|link}} equipment archetype, such as {{Plural|BotW|Lizal Spear|link}} that they also use to hunt for fish.<ref>{{Cite|Judging by the harpoon-like spearhead of this Lizalfos-made spear, the Lizalfos use it for fishing as well as combat. Try not to get caught on the wrong end of its barbs.|N/A|BotW}}</ref> They are sometimes also encountered utilizing {{Term|BotW|Hylian|link}}-made weapons. When defeated, they may drop {{Plural|BotW|Lizalfos Horn|link}}, {{Plural|BotW|Lizalfos Talon|link}}, and {{Plural|BotW|Lizalfos Tail|link}}.

{{Plural|BotW|Electric Lizalfos}}, found in places such as the {{Term|BotW|Gerudo Desert|link}} and {{Term|BotW|Zonai Ruins|link}}, have electrified horns that they can use to generate an electric field. If {{Term|BotW|Link}} manages to hit said horn with an {{Term|BotW|Arrow|link}}, it will cause the {{Plural|BotW|Electric Lizalfos}} to discharge involuntarily. He can use this to his advantage to electrocute nearby enemies. {{Plural|BotW|Ice-Breath Lizalfos}}, typically found in cold areas, will spit icy projectiles at {{Term|BotW|Link}}, and are weak to {{Term|BotW|Fire|link}}. {{Plural|BotW|Fire-Breath Lizalfos}}, found in {{Plural|BotW|Scorching Climate}} such as {{Term|BotW|Death Mountain|link}} and the {{Term|BotW|Gerudo Desert}}, can breathe {{Term|BotW|Fire}} at {{Term|BotW|Link}} and are vulnerable to {{Term|BotW|Ice|link}}.

There are also undead versions of {{Term|BotW|Lizalfos}}. {{Plural|BotW|Stalizalfos|link}} rise from the ground during the night in certain areas and attack {{Term|BotW|Link}}. {{Plural|BotW|Cursed Lizalfos|link}} can sometimes be found spawning from various {{Plural|BotW|Pool of Malice|link}} throughout {{Term|BotW|Hyrule}} and within the {{Plural|BotW|Divine Beast|link}}.

==Other Appearances==

{{Ambig|Start}}
[[File:LCT Temple of Time: Ranger Sprite.png|thumb|right|A {{Term|LCT|Lizalfos}} from {{LCT|-}}]]
{{Plural|LCT|Lizalfos}} appear as enemies in the {{Term|LCT|Temple of Time: Ranger|link}} {{Term|LCT|Stage|link}} in {{LCT}}. {{Plural|LCT|Lizalfos}} can move quickly and counter {{Term|LCT|Link}}'s attacks. They are able to block {{Term|LCT|Link|link}}'s {{Term|LCT|Crossbow|link}} shots with the gauntlets on their left claws, and attack by slashing either the blades they carry or the blades attached to their tails. They can also jump across the room in an attempt to surround {{Term|LCT|Link}}.
{{Ambig|End}}

==={{OoT|-}} (Himekawa)===
{{Noncanon|Start}}
Lizalfos appear in [[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (Himekawa)]], being summoned by the [[Twinrova]] witches alongside some [[Moblin]]s to try and slow Link down, who shoots an arrow into one's neck.
{{Noncanon|End}}

==={{HW|-}}===
{{Noncanon|Start}}
[[File:HWDE Lizalfos Mini Map Icon.png|left]]
{{Plural|HWDE|Lizalfos}} appear as elite enemies in {{HW}}, serving as {{Plural|HWDE|Captain (Hyrule Warriors)|link}} in several {{Term|HWDE|Forces|link}}. They carry blades and arm gauntlets with them, with which they use to attack and defend with. {{Plural|HWDE|Lizalfos}} also hop from side to side in battle. {{Plural|HWDE|Lizalfos}} can also attack either by slamming their foes with their tails or by breathing fire in the form of fireballs or streams. When blowing streams of fire, their {{Plural|HWDE|Weak Point Gauge|link}} are exposed. They are also weak to {{Plural|HWDE|Bomb|link}}.

{{Plural|HWDE|Lizalfos}} also appear as minor characters in certain {{Plural|HWDE|Scenario|link}}. In "{{Term|HWDE|Ganondorf's Return|link}}", a {{Term|HWDE|Lizalfos}} leads the {{Term|HWDE|Monster Forces|link}} of the {{Term|HWDE|Gerudo Desert (Hyrule Warriors)|link}}. In the Scenario "{{Term|HWDE|The Dragon of the Caves|link}}" of {{Term|HWDE|Cia's Tale|link}}, {{Plural|HWDE|Lizalfos Chieftain|link}} appear as {{Plural|HWDE|Captain (Hyrule Warriors)}} in {{Term|HWDE|Volga's Forces|link}}. They are accompanied by {{Plural|HWDE|Dinolfos Chieftain|link}}, and arrive as reinforcements when {{Term|HWDE|Cia|link}} tries to enlist {{Term|HWDE|Volga|link}} into her army. The {{Plural|HWDE|Lizalfos Chieftain}} are much larger and stronger variants of {{Plural|HWDE|Lizalfos}}. They also appear in multiple main story {{Plural|HWDE|Scenario}} that include {{Term|HWDE|Volga}}, such as "{{Term|HWDE|The Sorceress of the Valley|link}}", "{{Term|HWDE|Land in the Sky|link}}", all {{Plural|HWDE|Scenario}} in {{Term|HWDE|Cia's Tale}} except "{{Term|HWDE|The Demon Lord|link}}", and even in a mission in {{Term|HWDE|Linkle's Tale|link}}, "{{Term|HWDE|Powers Collide|link}}". {{Plural|HWDE|Lizalfos Chieftain}} are portrayed as {{Term|HWDE|Volga}}'s loyal servants, apologizing to their master when they must retreat during the battle with {{Term|HWDE|Ganondorf|link}} in the "{{Term|HWDE|Darkness Falls}}" {{Term|HWDE|Scenario}}.<ref>{{Cite|Too many enemies! We c-c-can't win!|Lizalfos Chieftain|HWDE}}</ref>

When defeated, {{Plural|HWDE|Lizalfos}} may drop {{Plural|HWDE|Lizalfos Scale|link}} as bronze {{Plural|HWDE|Material|link}} and {{Plural|HWDE|Lizalfos Gauntlet|link}} as silver {{Plural|HWDE|Material}}.
{{Noncanon|End}}

==={{CoH|-}}===
{{Ambig|Start}}
{{Plural|CoH|Lizalfos}} appear as enemies in {{CoH}}. They are mostly stationary enemies that move to the beat of the music, usually standing still while on the lookout for adventurers. Upon seeing {{Term|CoH|Cadence|link}}, {{Term|CoH|Link|link}}, {{Term|CoH|Yves|link}}, or {{Term|CoH|Princess Zelda|link}}, they will unsheathe their swords and proceed to charge at them, moving on every beat until they make contact with something. While charging, they can only move in one direction unless they step on a {{Term|CoH|Bounce Trap}}, which will force them to turn and resume their chase elsewhere. Once contact has been made, they will be stunned for three beats, leaving them vulnerable to attack until they regain consciousness on the fourth beat. In Symphony of the Mask, they blend in with their surroundings until [[Skull Kid]] approaches them, similar to ''Breath of the Wild''.
