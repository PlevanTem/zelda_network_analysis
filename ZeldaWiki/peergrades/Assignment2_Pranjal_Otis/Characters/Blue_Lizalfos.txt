{{Term/Store|Blue Lizalfos|Blue Lizalfos|Series, BotW, CoH|plural}} are recurring {{Plural|Series|Enemy|link}} in {{TLoZ|Series}}.<ref>{{Cite|'''{{Color|BotW Shrine Quest|Blue Lizalfos}}'''|Hyrule Compendium|BotW}}</ref>

==Characteristics==
==={{BotW|-}}===
{{Compendium/Extract|Blue Lizalfos}}
Blue Lizalfos are stronger than green [[Lizalfos]], as they have more health and carry stronger {{Plural|BotW|Weapon|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|Compared to the green Lizalfos, many of these carry much stronger weapons and are generally much tougher.|Hyrule Compendium|BotW}}</ref> Like other Lizalfos, they can be often be found in or around bodies of water, such as Lakes and Rivers, but they can also be found throughout the [[Gerudo Desert]].

==Other Appearances==
==={{CoH|-}}===
{{Ambig|Start}}
In {{CoH}}, {{Plural|CoH|Blue Lizalfos}} are not stronger than {{Term|CoH|Green Lizalfos|link}}, but they do wield spears, giving them a much farther reach when they attack. While their movement is bound to the beat of the music, they typically stand still until either {{Term|CoH|Cadence|link}}, {{Term|CoH|Link|link}}, {{Term|CoH|Yves|link}}, or {{Term|CoH|Princess Zelda|link}} crosses their path. Once they have the heroes within their sights, they will proceed to charge at them within a straight line, moving on every beat until they collide into something or the heroes stop their attack with their {{Term|CoH|Weapon|link}}, stunning them for three beats. While stunned, they are rendered completely defenseless until they regain consciousness on the fourth beat, returning to their original stance to look for targets.
