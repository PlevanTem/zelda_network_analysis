Urbosa battled with the [[Scimitar of the Seven]] and the [[Daybreaker]] shield.<ref>{{Cite|I want to offer you these as thanks for your help. I trust you'll accept them. These pieces of equipment are priceless treasures of the Gerudo people.

In {{TCB}} DLC [[Recovered Memory]], {{Term|BotW|Champion Urbosa's Song|link}}, Princess Zelda arrives to Gerudo Town seeking Urbosa, the current Gerudo chieftain, for aid against stopping Calamity Ganon. Urbosa accepts Zelda's proposition without hesitation, as the [[Yiga Clan]] are planning to resurrect Calamity Ganon and steal the Gerudo peoples' [[Thunder Helm|treasured heirloom]].<ref>{{Cite|Princess of Hyrule, I accept your proposition without hesitation. Not only are they planning to resurrect Calamity Ganon, it seems the Yiga Clan is also after our treasured heirloom.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref> Urbosa gives Zelda her word that she will not rest until the Calamity falls.<ref>{{Cite|You have my word, I won't rest until the Calamity falls.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref> Princess Zelda thanks the Gerudo chief on behalf of [[Hyrule]] and its [[King Rhoam|king]].<ref>{{Cite|Gerudo chief Urbosa... On behalf of Hyrule and its king, I thank you.|Zelda|BotW}}</ref> Later, Urbosa and Zelda laugh while they walk outside Gerudo Town's walls. Zelda remarks that she has never seen Urbosa so serious.<ref>{{Cite|I've never seen you so serious, Urbosa!|Zelda|BotW}}</ref> Urbosa cannot say the same, since ten years ago her "little bird" rarely smiled, referring to Zelda.<ref>{{Cite|Oh my. I can't say the same. Ten years ago, you rarely smiled, my little bird.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref> The Princess feels like Urbosa has called her "little bird" before and asks where she got the name from.<ref>{{Cite|Urbosa, I feel like you've called me little bird before. I was wondering where you got that name from.|Zelda|BotW}}</ref> Urbosa stands still and orders two men who had passed behind them to halt and face her.<ref>{{Cite|Halt. And face me.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref> She continues and calls the men traitors and that unlike them she prefers to face her enemies head on.<ref>{{Cite|Unlike you traitors, I prefer to face my enemies head on.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref> After the two hesitantly look at each other, Urbosa draws her Scimitar of the Seven and spins around, telling them to do their worst.<ref>{{Cite|Do your worst.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref> The two men, who are actually [[Yiga Footsoldier]]s, attack the Gerudo. Urbosa duels one of them before knocking the Yiga down using the [[Perfect Guard]] and hitting him in the stomach with her Scimitar hilt. She places the Daybreaker Shield on her back before using Urbosa's Fury to electrocute the second Yiga as he jumps in attempt to attack her from behind. Urbosa tells the Yiga that out of respect for the Princess, they may keep their lives and orders them to go.<ref>{{Cite|Out of respect for our princess, you may keep your lives. Now go.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref> When the Yiga leave, Urbosa sheathes her Scimitar and brings up Zelda's question about why she calls her "little bird."<ref>{{Cite|You asked why I call you little bird.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref> Urbosa says that when the Princess was a small child, her dear friend called her that,<ref>{{Cite|When you were but a small child...my dear friend called you that, with the sweetest smile that ever graced our land of Hyrule.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref> with Zelda realizing that Urbosa is referring to her mother.<ref>{{Cite|You mean Mother...|Zelda|BotW}}</ref> Urbosa says that it was ten long years ago when the Princess's mother had left the world, yet her "little bird" still spread her wings and became the beacon of light Hyrule needed.<ref>{{Cite|It was ten long years ago... Your mother had just left this world, yet her little bird still spread her wings and became the beacon of light Hyrule needed.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref> Urbosa says that sometimes she forgets herself and gets lost in the past.<ref>{{Cite|Sometimes I forget myself...and get lost in the past.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref>

During Link's first Recovered Memory, "[[Subdued Ceremony]]", Urbosa is seen with the other Champions as Zelda appoints Link as her knight. After the [[Rito]] Champion [[Revali]] complains about the ceremony and Link,<ref>{{Cite|You're the one who wanted to designate the appointed knight with all the ceremonial pomp, grandeur, and nonsense we could muster! And if you ask me, the whole thing does seem to be overkill.|Revali|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|I think I'm on the same page as the princess regarding...this boy.|Revali|BotW}}</ref> Urbosa tells him to give it a rest and that Link is a living reminder to Zelda of her failures.<ref>{{Cite|Oh, give it a rest. That boy is a living reminder of her own failures. Well, at least that's how the princess sees him.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref>

Prior to the events of Link's sixth Recovered Memory, "[[Urbosa's Hand]]", Link is called to the [[Gerudo Desert]] by Urbosa.<ref>{{Cite|Link is called to the Gerudo Desert by Urbosa. There, he sees Zelda, exhausted and asleep. Urbosa opens up about her concern for Zelda and reminds Link that it is a warrior's honor to protect a member of the royal family.|N/A|BotW}}</ref> During the Memory, Link arrives to the Divine Beast Vah Naboris to find Princess Zelda sleeping in Urbosa's arms. Urbosa remarks that Link got there quickly and that she should have expected such from Zelda's own appointed knight.<ref>{{Cite|Ah, well...you certainly got here fast.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|I should have expected as much, from the princess's own appointed knight.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref> Urbosa then explains that Zelda is exhausted from being out on a survey all day.<ref>{{Cite|She was out on a survey all day today. Still as the sands now...|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref> She then asks Link if he and Zelda have been getting along and quickly understands that they have not due to Link's response of silence.<ref>{{Cite|So...? Spill it, boy. Have the two of you been getting along all right?|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|It's OK... I know. Your silence speaks volumes.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref> Urbosa does not blame Link for their poor relationship and explains that Zelda feels like a failure in her destiny when seeing that Link has succeeded in his.<ref>{{Cite|She gets frustrated every time she looks up and sees you carrying that sword on your back.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|It makes her feel like a failure when it comes to her own destiny|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Don't worry, it's not like you carry blame in any of this.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref> She goes on to explain that Zelda has put more than enough time and dedication to accessing her [[Triforce|sealing power]], even passing out in freezing waters during one attempt.<ref>{{Cite|It's unfortunate. She's put in more than enough time.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Ever since she was a young girl, she's gone through rigorous daily routines to show her dedication...|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|She once passed out in the freezing waters trying to access this sealing power. And she has nothing to show for it...|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref> Urbosa sympathizes with Zelda, saying that she would be doing the same thing and that Zelda is quite special.<ref>{{Cite|That's the motivation driving her research. I'd be doing the same thing.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|She really is quite...special.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref> Telling Link to protect Zelda with his life, Urbosa turns to smile at Link and tells him that his role as her knight is quite an honor.<ref>{{Cite|You be sure to protect her with your life. It's quite the honor.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref> With the night getting cold, Urbosa feels that it is time to take Zelda inside, but suddenly a better idea strikes her.<ref>{{Cite|The night brings a chill... It's probably time we take her in.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref> Urbosa snaps her fingers to perform Urbosa's Fury, which causes lightning to strike into the Gerudo Desert and startles Zelda awake.<ref>{{Cite|Urbosa! What was that?! Did you feel that?!|Zelda|BotW}}</ref> Zelda turns to notice Link and questions what he is doing there.<ref>{{Cite|Wait, what—how did you—what are you doing here?!|Zelda|BotW}}</ref> Urbosa begins to laugh at Zelda's confusion as she asks what is funny.<ref>{{Cite|Wh-what's so funny?|Zelda|BotW}}</ref>

During Link's 15th Recovered Memory, "[[Return of Calamity Ganon]]", Urbosa and the other Champions wait near [[Mount Lanayru]] for Zelda to return from her journey to the [[Spring of Wisdom]]. After Zelda returns to report that she felt no power in the Spring, Urbosa suggests that they move on and that feeling sorry will not help.<ref>{{Cite|Then let's move on. You've done all you could.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Feeling sorry for yourself won't be of any help.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref> She also assures the Princess that the Spring of Wisdom was not her last shot and that they just need to find the thing that sparks her sealing power.<ref>{{Cite|After all, it's not like your last shot was up there on Mt. Lanayru.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Anything could finally spark the power to seal Ganon away. We just have to keep looking for that...thing.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref> Immediately after, Urbosa is proven wrong as [[Calamity Ganon]] begins to wake from its slumber. Urbosa tells Zelda that they need to get her somewhere safe before Zelda refuses,<ref>{{Cite|Come. We should go. We need to get you someplace safe.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref> pleading that there must be something she can do to help.<ref>{{Cite|No! I am not a child anymore! I may not be much use on the battlefield... But there must... There must be something I can do to help!|Zelda|BotW}}</ref>

Urbosa, as one of the four Champions who pilot the [[Divine Beast]]s, was a part of the plan to defeat Calamity Ganon 100 years prior to the events of {{BotW|-}}. Urbosa and the other Champions met their demise to Calamity Ganon's four incarnations of [[Malice]]. Urbosa was defeated by [[Thunderblight Ganon]].<ref>{{Cite|This formidable adversary was made by Ganon and brought me to a warrior's demise 100 years ago.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref> After her death, Urbosa lives on in the afterlife as a spirit and is trapped within Naboris. In {{BotW|-}}, Link enters the Divine Beast Vah Naboris, defeats Thunderblight Ganon and frees Urbosa's spirit.<ref>{{Cite|I knew you wouldn't let us down, Link. Thanks to your valor and skill, my soul is free and Naboris is ours once again.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref> Urbosa tells Link that she has waited for him to rush [[Hyrule Castle (Breath of the Wild)|Hyrule Castle]] so that she can incinerate Ganon into a pile of ash.<ref>{{Cite|I've waited so long for the moment to see you finally rush Hyrule Castle... As well as the moment when I incinerate Ganon into a pile of ash.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref> She rewards Link with Urbosa's Fury to aid him in his quest to defeat Calamity Ganon.<ref name="Urbosa's Fury">{{Cite|Please accept this gift, which has come to be known as Urbosa's Fury.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref> Urbosa understands how Link and Princess Zelda have suffered regarding the Champions' fates.<ref>{{Cite|Both you and the princess...I know you have suffered much regarding what happened to us Champions.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref> Urbosa accepts that things had to happen this way and no one need carry blame.<ref>{{Cite|But this is how things had to happen. No one need carry blame.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref> She asks Link to let Zelda know this and that she could not be more proud of her.<ref>{{Cite|So please, make it clear so she understands that. Tell her to shed any worries. And let her know...I couldn't be more proud of her.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref> Urbosa concludes by telling Link to take care of the Princess and Hyrule.<ref>{{Cite|You take good care of the princess. Oh, and also... Take good care of Hyrule.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref> When the Divine Beast Vah Naboris aims its beam at Calamity Ganon, Urbosa remarks how Naboris, who was named after the Gerudo sage [[Nabooru]], is a legend just like its namesake.<ref>{{Cite|Nabooru, Legend of the Gerudo, celebrated over ages. And you, who were named to honor her- you are a legend as well. Isn't that right, Naboris?|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref> Urbosa then says that Ganon once took the form of a Gerudo and likes that she can take her mission more personally.<ref>{{Cite|It was written that Calamity Ganon once adopted the form of a Gerudo. And that... will make this victory all the more satisfying. I like that. Now I can take this more personally.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref> She says once a lock is established on Ganon, it will be up to Link to occupy it until she and the Divine Beast unleash their strike.<ref>{{Cite|Once we've established a lock on that thing... It will be up to Link to keep Ganon occupied until the moment we unleash our strike.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref> After Link defeats Calamity Ganon, Urbosa's spirit is seen overlooking Hyrule atop Hyrule Castle with the spirits of the other Champions and King Rhoam.

After [[Kass]] plays Link [[EX Champions Urbosa's Song (Ballad)|Ex Champion Urbosa's Song]], Urbosa speaks to him from within Vah Naboris. She says Link is an impressive man and allows him to use Urbosa's Fury more often.<ref>{{Cite|I must say, you are an impressive voe. You may now wield Urbosa's Fury more often.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref> The Gerudo Champion finishes by saying Link is the pride of Hyrule and that she is leaving the honor of caring for Princess Zelda in his hands.<ref>{{Cite|You are the pride of Hyrule, hero. Take care of the princess. I'm leaving that honor in your capable hands.|Urbosa|BotW}}</ref> Link is then given [[Urbosa's Fury +]].<ref>{{Cite|Champion Urbosa's divine gift. Summons powerful lightning to the surrounding area. Trigger with a charge attack by holding (Y). It now requires less time to recharge.|N/A|BotW}}</ref>
