==Biography==
Garshon is a {{Term|BotW|Hylian|link}} found at {{Term|BotW|Serenne Stable|link}}, where he debates the cause of the leviathans' extinction with his brothers.<ref>{{Cite|We are in search of {{Color|BotW Red|leviathan}} bones in order to determine the cause of their extinction.|Garshon|BotW}}</ref> However, their search for the remains has not been lucky, so they have decided to rest at the {{Term|BotW|Stable|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|But we haven't had any luck. We are resting here for now while we plan our next move.|Garshon|BotW}}</ref> He wonders why they are wasting time at the Stable, when it would be better to go out and find the skeletons.<ref>{{Cite|Why stay here and waste time? Why not just go out and find it? Things like these are best accomplished on foot!|Garshon|BotW}}</ref>

When {{Term|BotW|Link|link}} speaks to Garshon's brother, {{Term|BotW|Akrah|link}}, he can hear the three brothers discussing their theories on the leviathans' extinction.<ref>{{Cite|Why did the {{Color|BotW Red|leviathans}} go extinct? That is the question we scientists are trying to answer.|Akrah|BotW}}</ref> Garshon's theory is that the leviathans went extinct due to a sudden drought.<ref>{{Cite|My theory is that the {{Color|BotW Red|leviathans}} of ancient times went extinct due to a sudden, cataclysmic drought long ago!|Garshon|BotW}}</ref> Akrah reveals to Link that they have a general idea where the three skeletons can be found,<ref>{{Cite|But we do have a general idea of where such remains might be found... The {{Color|BotW Blue|Eldin Mountains}} in the northeast, the {{Color|BotW Blue|Hebra region}} in the northwest, and the {{Color|BotW Blue|Gerudo region}} in the southwest.|Akrah|BotW}}</ref> and he asks Link to locate them and bring pictures back.<ref>{{Cite|Would you be willing to find these {{Color|BotW Red|leviathan bones}} and draw a {{Color|BotW Red|picture}} of them?|Akrah|BotW}}</ref> Accepting his request begins the "{{Term|BotW|Leviathan Bones|link}}" {{Term|BotW|Side Quest|link}}.

Garshon requires a picture of the {{Term|BotW|Gerudo Great Skeleton|link}}, located in the {{Term|BotW|Gerudo Desert|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|I must see that {{Color|BotW Red|leviathan}} skeleton from the {{Color|BotW Blue|Gerudo regions}}...|Garshon|BotW}}</ref> When Link shows him a picture, he is shocked at how good Link is at drawing.<ref>{{Cite|I cannot believe my eyes! You are REALLY good at drawing!|Garshon|BotW}}</ref> He believes it is the evidence he needs to prove his theory about the drought.<ref>{{Cite|With this, I'll finally be able to prove that the {{Color|BotW Red|leviathans}} went extinct due to a catastrophic drought!|Garshon|BotW}}</ref> He encourages Link to help Akrah and {{Term|BotW|Onya|link}} with their own pictures.<ref name="Brother"/> If Garshon is the last one that Link shows the picture to, he will give Link his reward.<ref>{{Cite|Thank you. Here's the reward we agreed upon.|Garshon|BotW}}</ref> He asserts that Link's pictures will be valuable for his and his brothers' research.<ref>{{Cite|Your pictures will do wonders for our research! Thanks again!|Garshon|BotW}}</ref>

Garshon is very invested in his theory, even panting in his sleep.<ref>{{Cite|Zzz...<br>*pant*<br>Zzz...|Garshon|BptW}}</ref> When Link speaks to him, he reiterates how useful the picture will be to him.<ref>{{Cite|Thanks to you picture, I'll be able to prove that {{Color|BotW Red|leviathans}} went extinct due to a severe prolonged drought.|Garshon|BotW}}</ref> He doesn't like rain,<ref>{{Cite|This weather is terrible...|Garshon|BotW}}</ref> but he likes to stay inside and think about leviathans during such times.<ref>{{Cite|On days like this, I like to stay in and think about {{Color|BotW Red|leviathans}}!|Garshon|BotW}}</ref>
