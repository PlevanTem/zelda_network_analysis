{{Term|BotW|Link}}'s seventh {{Term|BotW|Recovered Memory}}, "{{Term|BotW|Blades of the Yiga|link}}", can also be found at the {{Term|BotW|Kara Kara Bazaar}}.

I'm so exhausted by it.|Rhondson|BotW}}</ref> Upon speaking to {{Term|BotW|Rhondson}}, she comments that {{Term|BotW|Akkala|link}} is far away, but admits that she needs to get away from a village full of other women.<ref>{{Cite|The {{Color|BotW Blue|Akkala region}} is kinda far away.
