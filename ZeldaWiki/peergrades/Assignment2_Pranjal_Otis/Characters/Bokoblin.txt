{{Figurine|TWW|Bokoblin}}
{{Tingle|Bokoblin|A '''Bokoblin'''! Get ahold of yourself and get him! The Tingle Bomb might work too!}}
{{Plural|TWWHD|Bokoblin}} are prevalent in {{TWW}}. They have snouts, arrow-shaped tails, three fingers and a single horn. {{Plural|TWWHD|Bokoblin}} come in three variants: Blue, Green, and Pink. The most common is the blue-skinned, {{Term|TWWHD|Boko Stick|link}}-wielding combat form. Green-skinned elites carry {{Plural|TWWHD|Machete|link}} and wooden {{Plural|TWWHD|Shield|link}}. Pink {{Plural|TWWHD|Bokoblin}} carry {{Plural|TWWHD|Telescope|link}}, which they use to scan their surroundings and to attack. Unarmed {{Plural|TWWHD|Bokoblin}} will combat {{Term|TWWHD|Link|link}} hand-to-hand until they can find an available weapon. They can wield any kind of {{Term|TWWHD|Enemy Weapon|link}} as needed. They are even strong enough to wield {{Plural|TWWHD|Weapon}} such as {{Plural|TWWHD|Moblin Spear|link}} and {{Plural|TWWHD|Darknut Sword|link}} with one arm.{{Verify|TWWHD}} The attack power remains the same, however.{{Clarify|reason= What remains the same? The attack power of the Bokoblin, or that of the Darknut Sword?|TWWHD}}

{{Plural|TWWHD|Bokoblin}} are more intelligent than their {{Term|TWWHD|Moblin}} counterparts. {{Plural|TWWHD|Blue Bokoblin}} man the {{Plural|TWWHD|Searchlight|link}} in the {{Term|TWWHD|Forsaken Fortress|link}}, demonstrating an understanding of machinery. Pink {{Plural|TWWHD|Bokoblin}} act as scouts on the {{Term|TWWHD|Great Sea|link}}. They use their telescopes to scan the sea from {{Plural|TWWHD|Lookout Platform|link}} and rafts tied to {{Plural|TWWHD|Submarine|link}}. {{Plural|TWWHD|Bokoblin}} also recognize the danger of {{Plural|TWWHD|Bomb|link}} and will run away if {{Term|TWWHD|Link}} pulls one out. One {{Term|TWWHD|Green Bokoblin|link}} in {{Term|TWWHD|Forsaken Fortress}} serves as the first {{Term|TWWHD|Sub-Boss|link}} of the game. It guards {{Term|TWWHD|Link}}'s {{Term|TWWHD|Sword|link}} which he dropped entering the fortress.

{{Plural|TWWHD|Bokoblin}} attack by swiping their {{Plural|TWWHD|Weapon}} at {{Term|TWWHD|Link}}. Occasionally, {{Plural|TWWHD|Bokoblin}} will jump back and attempt to swing their {{Plural|TWWHD|Weapon}} at {{Term|TWWHD|Link}}, which can send the young hero flying backwards if they make contact. {{Plural|TWWHD|Green Bokoblin}} are a little more versatile as they are able to defend themselves with their {{Plural|TWWHD|Shield|link}}. However, they are not particularly tough {{Plural|TWWHD|Enemy}} and can be defeated by most conventional {{Plural|TWWHD|Item|link}} in the game, especially {{Term|TWWHD|Link}}'s {{Term|TWWHD|Sword}}. If they are knocked back, they may drop their {{Plural|TWWHD|Weapon}}, which {{Term|TWWHD|Link}} can use against them. Unarmed {{Plural|TWWHD|Bokoblin}} will resort to jumping and kicking at {{Term|TWWHD|Link}} to hurt him. {{Plural|TWWHD|Bokoblin}}, even the seafaring pink ones, cannot swim. Sometimes, when walking on a bridge, {{Plural|TWWHD|Bokoblin}} lose their balance and nearly fall, but manage to hang onto the edge. When this happens, a single hit of the {{Term|TWWHD|Sword}} or some other {{Term|TWWHD|Weapon}} causes the {{Term|TWWHD|Bokoblin}} to fall and drown.

All {{Plural|TWWHD|Bokoblin}} carry one {{Term|TWWHD|Joy Pendant|link}}, which may be dropped after they are defeated. These are easily {{Term|TWWHD|Thievery|link|display=stolen}} using the {{Term|TWWHD|Grappling Hook|link}}.

==={{TP|-}}===
In {{TP}}, {{Plural|TPHD|Bokoblin}} resemble long imp-like creatures; {{Plural|TPHD|Bokoblin}} lack tails, fur, and horns, and are much less intelligent than other instances of them. They are common in the southern and parts of the eastern areas of {{Term|TPHD|Hyrule Field|link}}, and are prominent in {{Term|TPHD|Faron Woods|link}}, but are driven out by {{Term|TPHD|Link}} as he is traversing the {{Term|TPHD|Forest Temple|link}}. They are first encountered in their blue-skinned variant, which carries a small stick and is easily felled. Later, they appear in a purple color and wield {{Plural|TPHD|Sword|link}}. {{Plural|TPHD|Purple Bokoblin|link}} are surprisingly resilient, capable of withstanding much abuse before death. However, they share the mental drawbacks of their blue counterparts.

Uniquely, {{Plural|TPHD|Bokoblin}} in {{TP|-}} appear to socialize with each other: two can be seen talking with one another in an area of {{Term|TPHD|Faron Woods}}, somewhere along the path to the {{Term|TPHD|Forest Temple}}.

{{Fi|Red Bokoblin (Leader)|As a symbol of its leadership, this creature wraps a cloth around its head. This visually communicates that it is more dominant than other Bokoblins.<br>It can call its underlings to arms using its horn.}}
:''See also: {{Term|Series|Technoblin|link}} and {{Term|Series|Cursed Bokoblin|link}}''
{{Plural|SSHD|Red Bokoblin}} appear as a common type of {{Term|SSHD|Enemy}} in {{SS}}, appearing in many places throughout the {{Term|SSHD|Surface|link}}. Their appearance resembles that of a Japanese ''{{Wp|Oni (folklore)|Oni}}'' more so than their previous incarnations. {{Plural|SSHD|Red Bokoblin}} have floppy ears as opposed to pointy ones, and noses instead of snouts. They are much bigger and stouter than previous {{Plural|Series|Bokoblin}} (slightly larger than {{Term|SSHD|Link|link}} himself), and have an extra edge of difficulty. They can block attacks with their {{Plural|SSHD|Weapon}}, and in order to defeat them, {{Term|SSHD|Link}} must slash around the {{Term|SSHD|Weapon}}. {{Plural|SSHD|Red Bokoblin (Archer)|link}} are also able to wield {{Plural|SSHD|Bow|link}}, while {{Plural|SSHD|Red Bokoblin (Leader)|link}} may carry a {{Term|SSHD|Monster Horn|link}} with which they can summon more {{Plural|SSHD|Red Bokoblin}}. This {{Term|SSHD|Monster Horn}} can be retrieved using the {{Term|SSHD|Whip|link}}. In addition to the {{Term|SSHD|Monster Horn}}, {{Plural|SSHD|Red Bokoblin}} may sometimes drop {{Plural|SSHD|Ornamental Skull|link}} or {{Plural|SSHD|Golden Skull|link}} as {{Plural|SSHD|Treasure|link}} when defeated. {{Plural|SSHD|Red Bokoblin}} also have the ability to balance on tightropes, but will fall off if {{Term|SSHD|Link}} shakes the rope they are on or if they are hit with a projectile or the {{Term|SSHD|Beetle|link}}. Most {{Plural|SSHD|Red Bokoblin}} are afraid of the {{Term|SSHD|Beetle}} and will run away; {{Plural|SSHD|Red Bokoblin (Archer)}} with {{Plural|SSHD|Bow}} will shoot it at first sight.

The {{Plural|SSHD|Red Bokoblin}} in {{SS|-}} appear to be somewhat more intelligent and sociable than their past incarnations, even establishing small {{Plural|SSHD|Monster Stronghold|link}} while conflicting with the native {{Term|SSHD|Mogma|link}} throughout {{Term|SSHD|Eldin Volcano|link}}.<ref>{{Cite|Grrr... Those creeps just shimmied on in and took over our territory.|Tyto|SSHD}}</ref> They defend these villages with the aid of lookout towers and large boulders, which they can roll downhill to hinder {{Term|SSHD|Link}}.

Multiple new variations of {{Term|SSHD|Bokoblin}} make an appearance in {{SS|-}}, such as {{Plural|SSHD|Technoblin|link}} and {{Plural|SSHD|Cursed Bokoblin|link}}. {{Plural|SSHD|Technoblin}} are found in {{Term|SSHD|Lanayru Desert|link}}, and like many other {{Plural|SSHD|Enemy}} in the area, harness {{Term|SSHD|Electricity|link}} to attack. {{Plural|SSHD|Cursed Bokoblin}} are zombies, and can only be found in the depths of the {{Term|SSHD|Ancient Cistern|link}} and the room in the {{Term|SSHD|Sky Keep|link}} that represents the former {{Term|SSHD|Dungeon|link}}. While these {{Plural|SSHD|Bokoblin}} do not wield {{Plural|SSHD|Weapon}}, they are extremely resilient and can withstand much more damage than their living counterparts. Later in the game, {{Plural|SSHD|Blue Bokoblin}} replace ordinary {{Plural|SSHD|Bokoblin}} as a more durable enemy, taking more hits to defeat. The {{Term|SSHD|Blue Bokoblin}} also has a new tactic of attack, similar to {{Term|SSHD|Link}}'s {{Term|SSHD|Jump Attack|link}}. {{Plural|SSHD|Green Bokoblin}} are the {{Term|SSHD|Dungeon}} and cave variant of {{Plural|SSHD|Bokoblin}}, wearing a skull helmet and wielding a stone club. Their skin slowly began to turn into a shade of green due to their sun-deficient lifestyle.<ref>{{Cite|This variety of Bokoblin enjoys dark places, such as caves. Its sunlight-deficient lifestyle has turned its skin a stomach-turning shade of green.|Fi|SS}}</ref>

After the "{{Term|SSHD|Song of the Hero|link}}" quest is completed, most of the various types of {{Plural|SSHD|Bokoblin}} and {{Plural|SSHD|Moblin}} disappear from the overworld completely, leaving {{Term|SSHD|Eldin Volcano}} and {{Term|SSHD|Faron Woods}} devoid of their presence, most likely leaving the woodlands due to the massive flooding caused by {{Term|SSHD|Faron (Dragon)|link}}, the {{Term|SSHD|Water Dragon}}. During the {{Term|SSHD|Horde Battle|link}}, all varieties of {{Plural|SSHD|Bokoblin}} either have significantly increased skills or numbers, even wielding {{Plural|SSHD|Bomb|link}}. However, {{Plural|SSHD|Ornamental Skull}} and {{Plural|SSHD|Golden Skull}} will not appear after {{Term|SSHD|Link}} defeats a {{Term|SSHD|Bokoblin}} during the {{Term|SSHD|Horde Battle}}.

According to {{Term|SSHD|Fi|link}}, they are obsessed with their ideal of fashion, particularly their unusual leopard-print underwear, which can be seen best if {{Term|SSHD|Link}} performs a {{Term|SSHD|Fatal Blow|link}} on one.<ref>{{Cite|None of them are intelligent by any definition of the word. Curiously, they seem to have a mysterious obsession with fashionable undergarments.|Fi|SSHD}}</ref> This is likely a reference to an Oni's tendency to wear tiger-print loincloths in Japanese folklore.

{{Compendium/Extract|Bokoblin}}
{{Plural|BotW|Bokoblin}} appear as common {{Plural|BotW|Enemy|link}} in {{BotW}}, often encountered in primitive {{Plural|BotW|Monster Stronghold|link}}. They can be found resting inside their camps at night and hunting {{Plural|BotW|Boar|link}} during the day. {{Plural|BotW|Monster Stronghold}} are often guarded by {{Plural|BotW|Bokoblin}} on small watchtowers. If one of these {{Plural|BotW|Bokoblin}} spots {{Term|BotW|Link|link}}, they will sound their horn, alerting the other {{Plural|BotW|Enemy}} to {{Term|BotW|Link}}'s presence. There are many varieties of {{Plural|BotW|Bokoblin}}, including the standard red {{Term|BotW|Bokoblin}}, {{Plural|BotW|Blue Bokoblin|link}}, {{Plural|BotW|Black Bokoblin|link}}, {{Plural|BotW|Silver Bokoblin|link}}, and in {{Term|BotW|Master Mode|link}}, {{Plural|BotW|Golden Bokoblin|link}}. {{Plural|BotW|Bokoblin}} often carry weapons of the {{Term|BotW|Bokoblin Gear|link}} equipment archetype, such as the {{Plural|BotW|Boko Club|link}}, {{Plural|BotW|Boko Bat|link}}, {{Plural|BotW|Boko Spear|link}} and {{Plural|BotW|Boko Bow|link}}. Stronger {{Plural|BotW|Bokoblin}} are often equipped with Spiked and Dragonbone versions of this gear, alongside {{Plural|BotW|Soldier's Broadsword|link}}, {{Plural|BotW|Knight's Broadsword|link}} and {{Plural|BotW|Royal Broadsword|link}} at higher tiers. {{Plural|BotW|Bokoblin}} that lack {{Plural|BotW|Weapon|link}} will either swipe at {{Term|BotW|Link}} if he is nearby or dig up rocks to throw at him in lieu of any objects in the vicinity. If there are any large rocks, {{Plural|BotW|Barrel|link}}, or {{Plural|BotW|Bomb Barrel|link}}, {{Plural|BotW|Bokoblin}} will attempt to pick them up and hurl them at {{Term|BotW|Link}}. When equipped with a wooden melee {{Term|BotW|Weapon|link}} while near a source of fire, they will ignite their {{Term|BotW|Weapon}} to burn {{Term|BotW|Link}} with it. At night, {{Plural|BotW|Bokoblin}} will sleep on the ground face-up as bubbles rise from their nostrils. When defeated, {{Plural|BotW|Bokoblin}} may drop {{Plural|BotW|Bokoblin Fang|link}}, {{Plural|BotW|Bokoblin Horn|link}}, and {{Plural|BotW|Bokoblin Guts|link}}.

{{Plural|BotW|Bokoblin}} will occasionally be found riding {{Plural|BotW|Horse|link}}. If dismounted by an attack, they will attempt to climb back on their mount. {{Plural|BotW|Bokoblin}} in the {{Term|BotW|Gerudo Highlands|link}} may instead ride {{Plural|BotW|Honeyvore Bear|link}} and {{Plural|BotW|Grizzlemaw Bear|link}}.       

Sometimes, {{Plural|BotW|Bokoblin}} can be seen attacking travelers. Some travelers may also be knocked out by a Bokoblin. If {{Term|BotW|Link}} helps to defeat the Bokoblin(s), they may grant Link a reward. However, some travelers who are knocked out may be {{Term|BotW|Yiga Clan|link}} members.

The skeletal remains of {{Plural|BotW|Bokoblin}}, known as {{Plural|BotW|Stalkoblin|link}}, will rise out of the ground during the night. They behave similarly to living {{Plural|BotW|Bokoblin}}, while also possessing undead qualities. They may be found riding {{Plural|BotW|Stalhorse|link}} in lieu of living steeds.

==={{StBotW|-}}===
{{Future Release|Game}}
{{Plural|StBotW|Bokoblin}} appear as {{Plural|StBotW|Enemy}} in the {{StBotW}}. They resemble their {{BotW}} counterparts, but with longer {{Plural|StBotW|Bokoblin Horn|link|display=Horns}}.

==Other Appearances==
==={{CoH|-}}===
{{Ambig|Start}}
{{Plural|CoH|Bokoblin}} appear as enemies in {{CoH}}. They behave like the skeleton enemies in ''{{Wp|Crypt of the NecroDancer}}'', moving onto an adjacent tile on every other beat of the music in pursuit of {{Term|CoH|Cadence|link}}, {{Term|CoH|Link|link}}, {{Term|CoH|Yves|link}}, or {{Term|CoH|Princess Zelda|link}}. Before moving, they put their arms up for one beat before moving on the following beat.<ref>{{Cite|This monster has a very {{Color|CoH Blue|simple pattern}}, too. He moves every {{Color|CoH Blue|second beat}} and puts his {{Color|CoH Blue|arms up}} before he jumps!|Trill|CoH}}</ref>

==={{HW|-}}===
{{Noncanon|Start}}
{{Plural|HWDE|Bokoblin}} appear based on their red {{SS|-}} incarnation in {{HW}}. Their role are weak infantry troops, appearing in large numbers but are easily defeated. They mainly serve as the soldiers of the {{Plural|HWDE|Dark Force|link}}. As with other infantry troops, they also have a {{Term|HWDE|Captain (Hyrule Warriors)|link}}, Shield, Artillery and {{Term|HWDE|Summoner|link}} counterparts. In {{Term|HWDE|Legend Mode|link}}, they appear in "{{Term|HWDE|The Armies of Ruin|link}}", "{{Term|HWDE|The Sorceress of the Valley|link}}", "{{Term|HWDE|Land in the Sky|link}}", "{{Term|HWDE|Sealed Ambition|link}}", and "{{Term|HWDE|The Sacred Sword|link}}". In "{{Term|HWDE|The Armies of Ruins}}", a small group of {{Plural|HWDE|Bokoblin}} drops boulders in front of the {{Term|HWDE|Mine Entrance|link}}, attempting to trap {{Term|HWDE|Link}} inside.

Most {{Plural|HWDE|Bokoblin}} are regular foot soldiers that carry large blades. Artillery troops also occasionally appear in smaller groups and fight by shooting {{Plural|HWDE|Arrow|link}}. {{Plural|HWDE|Summoner Bokoblin}} also appear as an uncommon variant that summons reinforcements, and wear skull masks and carry staves. Unit troops are led by {{Plural|HWDE|Bokoblin Captain}}, which wear helmets and carry metal shields. The same type of {{Term|HWDE|Captain (Hyrule Warriors)}} also appears as a variant that guards {{Plural|HWDE|Keep|link}} and {{Plural|HWDE|Outpost|link}}. {{Plural|HWDE|Bokoblin Captain}} occasionally drop {{Plural|HWDE|Old Rag|link}} when defeated.

As one of {{Term|HWDE|Ghirahim}}'s attacks with the {{Term|HWDE|Demon Blade|link}}, he can summon a small group of {{Plural|HWDE|Bokoblin}} to charge forward.
