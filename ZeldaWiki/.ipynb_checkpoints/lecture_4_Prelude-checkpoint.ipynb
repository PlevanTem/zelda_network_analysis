      "Zelda is not only the princess of Hyrule, she is also an aspiring scholar who is very curious. She is also the leader of the [[Champion]]s of Hyrule. Zelda is the mysterious voice that guides {{Term|BotW|Link|link}} throughout his journey while she contains Calamity Ganon inside of Hyrule Castle. Zelda has been training to unlock her sealing powers passed down the royal family since she was 7 years old, one year after her mother unexpectedly passed away. With her mother gone there was nobody else around with the sacred power who could teach her how to use it, leaving Zelda to figure it out on her own. 100 years prior to the events of BotW, Zelda met with the Champions. After meeting with them, she left the Castle to research ancient technology, but she did not come across anything of note. During this time, she felt the presence of {{Term|BotW|Calamity Ganon|link|display=Ganon}} and devoted herself to learning all she could about ancient relics in order to stop him. She then met with a fortune teller who told her a prophecy, to which Zelda felt that there was not much time left. The following day, Link was appointed as Zelda\\'s knight, to Zelda\\'s chagrin. During the ceremony, [[Urbosa]] explains that Link is a living reminder of Zelda\\'s own failures. Link and Zelda then set out to [[Goron City]] to make adjustments to the {{Term|BotW|Divine Beast Vah Rudania|link}} to make it easier for [[Daruk]] to control. During their journey to [[Eldin (Region)|Eldin]], Zelda comes to a stop and asks him how proficient he is wielding his [[Master Sword|Sword]] and asks him if he can hear the voice within the blade.\n"
