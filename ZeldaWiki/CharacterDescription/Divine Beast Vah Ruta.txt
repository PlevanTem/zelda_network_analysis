It is a giant machine that resembles an elephant.\n\n==History==\nOne hundred years before the events of {{BotW|-}}, Ruta was piloted by [[Mipha]], the [[Zora]] [[Champion]]. After [[Calamity Ganon]] took control of it, it created a torrential downpour in the [[Lanayru Great Spring]]. If [[Link]] approaches it before defeating [[Waterblight Ganon]], he will be thrown backwards by its barrier.\n\n==Entrance to the Divine Beast==\nBefore Link can board Ruta, he must team up with [[Sidon]] to disable it. Link must disable the switches on Ruta's sides by swimming up waterfalls and shooting them with [[Shock Arrow]]s. Each time Link disables a switch, Ruta launches an increasingly savage volley of ice blocks and spheres towards the duo, which Link must break in order to progress. Once he has deactivated all the switches, the endless rain around Zora's Domain ceases and the machine becomes accessible.\n\n==Themes and Navigation==\nOnce inside, Link can control Ruta's trunk and move it between various positions. It constantly spews water, allowing Link to position the stream of water by extension. In order to calm Ruta, Link must activate each of the five terminals located throughout it with his [[Sheikah Slate]]. After Link activates them all, he can proceed to fight [[Waterblight Ganon]].\n\nUpon defeating Waterblight Ganon, Link is visited by Mipha's spirit and receives [[Mipha's Grace]], a magical power similar to that of a [[Fairy]]. He is also rewarded with Mipha's [[Lightscale Trident]] by [[Muzu]]. Ruta, now commanded by Mipha's spirit, climbs atop a cliff and targets [[Hyrule Castle]] in preparation of Link's fight against Ganon.\n\n===Minor Enemies===\n<gallery>\nFile:BotW Malice Model.png|[[Malice]]\nFile:BotW Guardian Scout I Model.png|[[Guardian Scout I]]\nFile:BotW Guardian Scout II Model.png|[[Guardian Scout II]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Nomenclature==\nDivine Beast Vah Ruta is named after [[Princess Ruto]],<ref>{{Cite|Long, long ago... In a past more distant that even the Great Calamity or the creation of the Divine Beast Vah Ruta... There was a Zora princess named Ruto. We know that she was an attendant to the Zora patron deity and that she was a fair and lively girl, beloved to all. Around that same time, an evil man with designs on ruling the world appeared, bringing disaster upon Zora's Domain. It is said that Ruto then awoke as a sage, facing this foe alongside the princess of Hyrule and the hero of legend. Her achievements are remembered not only by the Zora, they are also forever etched into the history of Hyrule. The Divine Beast Vah Ruta, built ages later to face off against Calamity Ganon, was named in honor of Ruto. That the Zora princess\u2014my sweet daughter Mipha\u2014was chosen to pilot Ruta is surely the work of fate.|History of the Zora, Part Five|BotW}}</ref> the Sage of Water from {{OoT}}.\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:BotW Divine Beast Vah Ruto Map.png|The Sheikah Slate's map of Divine Beast Vah Ruta\nFile:HWAoC Divine Beast Vah Ruta Render.png|Render of Divine Beast Vah Ruta from {{HWAoC|-}}\nFile:HWAoC Vah Ruta Icon.png|Vah Ruta's icon from {{HWAoC|-}}\n</gallery>\n\n{{Ref}}\n\n{{DungeonNav2|BotW}}\n{{Categories\n |Divine Beasts, Lanayru Great Spring\n |dungeons= BotW\n |objects= BotW, HWAoC\n}}"}}}]}}}}
