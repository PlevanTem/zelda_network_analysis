The design of the dungeon resembles an engine, suggesting a connection to the [[Master Cycle Zero]], the item received when completing this trial.\n\n==Entrance to the Trial==\nThe Final Trial is accessed from the [[Shrine of Resurrection]]. After inserting the [[Sheikah Slate]] into the pedestal, the door is sealed and the chamber itself descends into the [[Dungeon]]. The door opens before the descent is complete, however, a magical barrier prevents the elevator from being exited prematurely. If [[Link]] has found the [[Korok]] in the Shrine of Resurrection, it is not there when the elevator is descended.\n\n==Themes and Navigation==\nUpon entering the Dungeon, Link hears the voice of [[Monk Maz Koshia]], who greets him and tells him that it is time to face the Final Trial.<ref>{{Cite|Welcome, hero. You have overcome many trials to reach me. Now it is time to face the final trial.|Monk Maz Koshia|BotW}}</ref> He then informs Link that he will need a [[Map]] and that he can obtain map information from the nearby [[Guidance Stone]].<ref>{{Cite|This trial is a complex labyrinth. To start, you will need a map. You may obtain map information from the Guidance Stone.|Monk Maz Koshia|BotW}}</ref> The Dungeon is comprised of a central chamber containing a series of mechanical gears. Four adjoining chambers are themed after each of the other Divine Beasts and four Champions, with elemental themes of wind, water, fire, and thunder. The side-chambers contain gears and rotating walls and objects, but these will only move if the chambers are connected to the central mechanism via metallic or stone objects. Once the Dungeon Map has been obtained, the gears can be configured to rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise, which will have a cascading effect on the side-chambers if they have been connected to the central mechanism.\n\nThis Dungeon is unique in that enemies will gradually appear in the central chamber as the terminals are activated. Initially, only a sole [[Guardian Scout I]] is present, but three additional [[Guardian Scout I|Guardian Scout]]s along with a [[Guardian Scout II]] appear after activating the first terminal. After activating a second, a [[Guardian Turret]] appears in the center of the Dungeon. After the third terminal is activated, [[Guardian Skywatcher]]s will patrol the chamber.\n\nLink can find a [[Treasure Chest]] containing a [[Gerudo Scimitar]] in the thunder chamber, one containing a [[Cobble Crusher]] in the fire chamber, one containing a [[Swallow Bow]] in the wind chamber, and one containing a [[Zora Spear]] in the water chamber. Each of these {{Plural|BotW|Weapon|link}} are the Weapons required to craft each of the Champions' Weapons. In addition, Link can find a [[Diamond]] in a Treasure Chest, which is also required to craft a Champions' Weapon. Link can also find a [[Gerudo Shield]] in a Treasure Chest within the Dungeon, which can be crafted into [[Urbosa]]'s [[Daybreaker]] [[Shields in Breath of the Wild|Shield]]. Lastly, Link can find a Treasure Chest containing 5 [[Bomb Arrow]]s.\n\nEach of the themed chambers contains a [[Terminal]] that Link can authenticate with his [[Sheikah Slate]] to unlock a single bolt on a large stone door at the rear of the central chamber.<ref>{{Cite|Sheikah Slate authenticated.|Terminal|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Deactivating one lock of the door.|Terminal|BotW}}</ref> The Terminal will then tell Link how many Terminals remain.<ref>{{Cite|There are three terminals remaining.|Terminal|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|There are two terminals remaining.|Terminal|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|There is one terminal remaining.|Terminal|BotW}}</ref> After the final Terminal lock has been deactivated, the last Terminal will tell Link that he can now access the deepest area of the Dungeon.<ref>{{Cite|All terminal locks have been deactivated. You can now access the deepest area.|Terminal|BotW}}</ref> Once all four locks are disengaged, the door opens to reveal [[Monk Maz Koshia]].\n\nMonk Maz Koshia tells Link that he has proven to possess the power of a true hero and then begins to move.<ref>{{Cite|You have proven to possess the power of a true hero.|Monk Maz Koshia|BotW}}</ref> Maz Koshia then stands up, offering Link the Final Trial as they are transported to an arena hovering in the sky directly above the [[Great Plateau]].<ref>{{Cite|In the name of the Goddess Hylia...
