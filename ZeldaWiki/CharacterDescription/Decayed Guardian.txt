They are found buried in the ground, unable to move due to having no legs. Decayed Guardians appear inactive until {{Term|BotW|Link|link}} approaches it, when they light up and aim their laser sights at Link in preparation to fire.<ref>{{Cite|Approach with caution; some of these derelict models have been known to awaken from stasis and attack when approached.|Hyrule Compendium|BotW}}</ref> A massive amount of Decayed Guardians can be found in the [[Forgotten Temple]] and will simultaneously take aim at Link the moment he enters the temple. They are prone to malfunctioning after being attacked, firing off several lasers in rapid succession.\n\nIf Link performs a [[Perfect Guard]] with any [[Shields in Breath of the Wild|Shield]] on its laser, it is instantly defeated. If {{Term|BotW|Link}} hits a Decayed Guardian in its eye using a bow, it will temporarily stun it. Using [[Stasis|Stasis +]] on a charging up Decayed Guardian will stun them afterwards, even if not hit during stasis.\n\nIn [[Master Mode]], Decayed Guardians will sometimes take slightly longer in their charge up phase before firing their laser to throw off Link's timing.\n\n===Drops===\nA Decayed Guardian drops between 4 and 6 of:\n{{BotWDropTable | Ancient Screw | 40 | Ancient Spring | 25 | Ancient Gear | 20 | Ancient Shaft | 15 }}\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:BotW Eastern Abbey Guardian.png|A Decayed Guardian attacking Link\nFile:BotW Perfect Guard Projectile.png|Link performing a Perfect Guard on a Decayed Guardian's laser\n</gallery>\n\n==See Also==\n* [[Guardian (Breath of the Wild)|Guardian]]\n* [[Guardian Stalker]]\n* [[Guardian Scout]]\n* [[Guardian Turret]]\n* [[Guardian Skywatcher]]\n* [[Sentry]]\n\n{{Ref}}\n\n{{Categories\n |Ancient Technology, Guardians\n |enemies= BotW\n}}"}}}]}}}}
