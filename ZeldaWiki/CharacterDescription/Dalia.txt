Dalia can be found sleeping at [[Gerudo Town#Lorn's General Store|Lorn's General Store]] during the night and Lorn is her mother.<ref>{{Cite|My mama sells a bunch of fruit! They're super yummy, so you should buy some, vai-from-out-of-town! Anyway, sav'orq!|Dalia|BotW}}</ref> Link can find Dalia and the other three children in Gerudo Town speaking to each other as a group as the sun sets. [[Kalani]] asks them if they are in love.<ref>{{Cite|Hey, you guys! Are you in love?|Kalani|BotW}}</ref> [[Makure]] then responds that she wants to attend [[Ashai]]'s class when she grows up and get married.<ref>{{Cite|When I'm all growed up, I will be! I'll go to Miss Ashai's class, and I'll become in love and I'll get married!|Makure|BotW}}</ref> [[Pearle]] then comments that Ashai is unmarried and wonders what that means.<ref>{{Cite|Mom says it's really strange that Miss Ashai is unmarried but teaches her class on voe. I wonder what unmarried means...|Pearle|BotW}}</ref> Lastly, Dalia says that she heard being in love is the sweetest thing in the world, but does not think she can handle something sweeter than berries.<ref>{{Cite|I heard that being in love and being married is the sweetest thing in the world! But I really like berries, and those are really sweet. I don't know if I can handle something sweeter than that!|Dalia|BotW}}</ref>\n\nAt a certain point, Link will find Dalia crying in an empty area near [[The Noble Canteen]]. She is crying because she wanted to plant a fruit orchard there,<ref>{{Cite|I...wanted to use that water and work really hard to plant a fruit orchard...|Dalia|BotW}}</ref> but the water from the nearby water trough is unusable due to a flow of trash in it.<ref>{{Cite|All this {{Color|BotW Red|trash}} keeps getting washed down into the water trough, and now I can't use the water there anymore.|Dalia|BotW}}</ref> After she is finished speaking, Link will receive \"[[The Mystery Polluter]]\" Side Quest. Link finds out that the source of the trash is a Gerudo named Calyban who enjoys eating [[Hydromelon]]s on the walls of Gerudo Town and throwing the rinds into the waterway. This pollutes the water trough that Dalia needs in order to grow a fruit orchard. Link convinces Calyban to stop by giving her 10 [[Wildberry|Wildberries]].<ref>{{Cite|You bring me a {{Color|BotW Blue|wildberry}}, and I can hold off on eating so many melons.|Calyban|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Yes, I'll need at least {{Color|BotW Red|10}}...|Calyban|BotW}}</ref> Calyban then feels bad for Dalia, so she helps clean up the trash.<ref>{{Cite|Now that my craving's been satisfied, I realize just how horribly selfish I've been... Shame on me.|Calyban|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|I'm going to go help clean up the trash!|Calyban|BotW}}</ref> \n\nWhen Link returns to Dalia, Calyban has already cleaned up her trash and left.<ref>{{Cite|Hey! You! Listen to this! Some other vai I've never met before helped me clean up the trash!|Dalia|BotW}}</ref> Dalia gives Link a Hydromelon that was given to her by \"the lady who cleaned it up\" as a thank you for caring about her.<ref>{{Cite|Oh! I also got a hydromelon from the lady who cleaned it up! I'll share! It's a sarqso for caring about me!|Dalia|BotW}}</ref> Dalia says that she also gave her some Wildberries, so Dalia decides that she is going to grow a Wildberry patch there.<ref>{{Cite|Oh, yeah, the lady who helped clean gave me some wildberries! So now my field is gonna be a wildberry patch!|Dalia|BotW}}</ref> She tells Link he can come eat the Wildberries anytime he likes and \"The Mystery Polluter\" Side Quest will be complete.<ref>{{Cite|You can come eat the berries anytime you like! It'll be great!|Dalia|BotW}}</ref> Just as Dalia says, Link can come back later to find that three Wildberry plants have grown there.\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:BotW Dalia.jpg|Dalia crying at the beginning of \"[[The Mystery Polluter]]\" Side Quest\n</gallery>\n\n{{Ref}}\n\n{{Categories\n |Gerudo\n |characters= BotW\n}}"}}}]}}}}
