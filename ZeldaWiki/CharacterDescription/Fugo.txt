He can be found outside of the blacksmith [[Rohan]]'s house. Fugo is training under Rohan as his apprentice so that he may one day be his successor.<ref>{{Cite|My name is Fugo. I've been trainin' hard so that I can carry on Master Rohan's work one day.|Fugo|BotW}}</ref>\n\nAs part of his training, Fugo was assigned by Rohan to defeat every [[Igneo Talus]] around Goron City.<ref>{{Cite|Master Rohan is a godly blacksmith. He's responsible for keepin' the ancient arts alive! He's really strict with everyone\u2014me included. In my case, he told me to beat every {{Color|BotW Blue|Igneo Talus}} around Goron City as part of my training.|Fugo|BotW}}</ref> He later explains that Rohan fought every Igneo Talus to grow stronger when he was young, and hopes to also reach that same goal.<ref>{{Cite|{{Color|BotW Blue|Master}} fought the Igneo Talus when he was young, and he got stronger that way.

Upon defeating the Igneo Talus and returning to Fugo, he is surprised to learn that Link defeated the monster. Fugo then decides to offer Link 100 [[Rupee]]s in exchange for the achievement, and gives him a [[Rupee|Silver Rupee]] in return.<ref>{{Cite|Whaaaa\u2014?!
