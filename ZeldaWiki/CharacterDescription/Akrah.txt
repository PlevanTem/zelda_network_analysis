You drew this?!|Akrah|BotW}}</ref> With the picture, he believes he'll be able to prove his theory about the volcanic eruption.<ref>{{Cite|With this, I'll finally be able to prove that the {{Color|BotW Red|leviathans}} went extinct as a result of a massive volcanic eruption!|Akrah|BotW}}</ref> If Link hasn't delivered pictures to Onya or Garshon by the time he speaks to him, Akrah will ask Link to assist in their research as well.<ref name=\"Brothers\"/> If Akrah is the last scientist to have his photo delivered, he will be the one to give Link his reward.<ref>{{Cite|Ah!
