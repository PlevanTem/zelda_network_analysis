The Molduking is a giant [[Molduga]] that gained power by resting underground for centuries, absorbing iron into its skin to bolster its defensive capabilities far beyond its Molduga counterparts.<ref>{{Cite|This massive monster swims beneath the desert's sand. It is a subspecies of Molduga that stored up a great deal of energy by sleeping underground for hundreds of years. Its power is superior to Molduga, as its skin is rich with iron and acts as a protective shield.|Hyrule Compendium|BotW}}</ref> Consequently, the Molduking is seen with a [[Gerudo Spear]], [[Golden Claymore]], [[Rusty Broadsword]], [[Rusty Halberd]], and a [[Throwing Spear]] sticking out of its hide, indicating failed attempts to slay it. In the \"EX Champion Urbosa's Song\" Main Quest, Link must slay the Molduking in order to make the [[Keive Tala Shrine]] appear.<ref>{{Cite|The scattered One-Hit Obliterator led you to a location where a stone monument with a map of trials appeared.

When it detects prey moving upon the sand, the Molduking will rush towards the disturbance and leap into the air, attempting to consume anything nearby in its mouth. Link can trick the Molduking into exposing itself by throwing [[Remote Bomb]]s or shooting [[Bomb Arrow]]s at the sand near it. If it is struck by either explosive force while in the air, the Molduking will fall to the desert floor and temporarily lie stunned.\n\nLike the {{Term|BotW|Igneo Talus Titan|link}}, the defeat of the Molduking does not count towards its respective {{Term|BotW|Medal of Honor|link}}.\n\n==Nomenclature==\nThe {{Term|BotW|Molduking}}s' name comes from {{Term|Series|Molduga|link}} and {{Wp|King}}, referencing how it is the strongest {{Term|Series|Molduga}} around.\n\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n==See Also==\n* {{Term|Series|Molduga|link}}\n\n{{Ref}}\n\n{{Bosses|BotW}}\n{{Categories\n |Sand-Related Enemies\n |bosses= BotW\n}}"}}}]}}}}
