They can be destroyed by using the [[King of Red Lions]]' [[Cannon]]. Wall-mounted Cannons can be found during the second visit to the [[Forsaken Fortress]] and on the [[Islet of Steel]], protecting their exteriors. They can also be found inside the six [[Eye Reefs]].<ref>{{Cite Guide|quote= |game= TWW|publisher= Nintendo|page= 89}}</ref> When all of them are destroyed, a [[Treasure Chest]] containing a [[Treasure Chart]] appears on one of the \"eyes\" inside the reefs. Cannons can also be found protecting some [[Lookout Platform]]s on the [[Great Sea]]. They can be destroyed by using the boat's Cannon or by dropping Bombs while on the platform. Treasure Chests can also appear on some Lookout Platforms when all the Cannons are destroyed.<ref>{{Cite Guide|quote= |game= TWW|publisher= Nintendo|page= 90}}</ref>\n\n==={{BotW|-}}===\nIn {{BotW}}, Cannons are found on the [[Divine Beast]] {{Term|BotW|Divine Beast Vah Medoh|link}} when Link attempts to board it with the aid of [[Teba]].
