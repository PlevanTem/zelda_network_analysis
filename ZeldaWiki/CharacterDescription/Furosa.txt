If [[Link]] speaks to Furosa, she greets him and is surprised to see a \"Hylian vai.\"<ref>{{Cite|Vasaaq... Oh, are you a Hylian vai? We don't see too many of you...|Furosa|BotW}}</ref> Furosa comments that Link seems too young to come to her Canteen and explains that they mix special drinks for adults there.<ref>{{Cite|I can't tell how old you are, but you look a little young to be coming to my shop.|Furosa|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|You see, we mix special drinks here. Drinks that are definitely just for adults...|Furosa|BotW}}</ref> If Link asks about the special drinks, Furosa explains that they make the drinks with the ice from the [[Northern Icehouse]].<ref>{{Cite|Well, a big part of the drink is the ice we use from the {{Color|BotW Blue|icehouse}}. It makes them especially refreshing.|Furosa|BotW}}</ref> If Link asks for drink recommendations, Furosa tells Link about their featured cocktail, the Noble Pursuit.<ref>{{Cite|Our featured cocktail is called {{Color|BotW Blue|Noble Pursuit}}. Many of our customers come here specifically to order it.|Furosa|BotW}}</ref> Furosa describes her Noble Pursuit as a light, sweet and cool sensation and that it is like drinking \"distilled motivation.\"<ref>{{Cite|The light, sweet taste... The cool sensation from each sip... It's like drinking distilled motivation!|Furosa|BotW}}</ref> If Link asks if they serve [[Milk]] in reference to the [[Milk Bar]] from past ''Zelda'' games, Furosa is appalled by the idea of serving something so childish.<ref>{{Cite|Milk?! We don't carry anything as childish as milk here!|Furosa|BotW}}</ref> She then complains, thinking that [[Greta]] sent Link to say that as a prank and criticizes the [[Gerudo Secret Club]] for only drawing young people's attention.<ref>{{Cite|Did Greta tell you to come here and ask that? That store clerk is just playing a prank on you. Good grief, doesn't she have anything better to do with her time?|Furosa|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|She's always being so secretive about her shop. But hiding something just makes young people more interested...|Furosa|BotW}}</ref> When Link ends the conversation, Furosa comments that she has not seen [[Pokki]] in a while,<ref>{{Cite|That reminds me... I haven't seen Pokki around lately...|Furosa|BotW}}</ref> explaining that Pokki used to come to the Canteen every day to drink Noble Pursuit.<ref>{{Cite|She used to come here every day to drink a {{Color|BotW Blue|Noble Pursuit}}, too.|Furosa|BotW}}</ref> Furosa cuts herself off and apologizes after realizing that there is no reason to talk to Link about this.<ref>{{Cite|Oh, I'm sorry! I don't know why I'm even telling you this.|Furosa|BotW}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Shrine Quest]], \"[[The Perfect Drink]]\", Link tries to order a Noble Pursuit from Furosa. However, she needs a huge amount of ice to make the drink and she is all out.<ref>{{Cite|Unfortunately, I need a huge amount of ice to make that drink, and I'm fresh out right now.|Furosa|BotW}}</ref> After Link informs her that Pokki has collapsed, she instructs Link to get ice for her from the [[Northern Icehouse]]. Upon arriving to the Northern Icehouse, Link quickly gets permission from [[Anche]] to take some ice.<ref>{{Cite|You're permitted to take some ice.|Anche|BotW}}</ref> Link must now carry the ice to Furosa, who is waiting for Link past the ruins south of the Icehouse. Once Link successfully makes it to Furosa with the ice, she tells him that she may be able to make the best Noble Pursuit she has ever made with this ice.<ref>{{Cite|I'll be able to make a {{Color|BotW Blue|Noble Pursuit}} with this. It may be the best I've ever made...|Furosa|BotW}}</ref> She then tells Link to go let Pokki know that the \"best drink ever\" is waiting for her.<ref>{{Cite|I've got one more favor to ask. Could you go and let {{Color|BotW Blue|Pokki}} know? Just tell her the best drink ever is waiting for her...|Furosa|BotW}}</ref>\n\nIf Link talks to Anche afterward, she will ask him to deliver more ice to Furosa for her.<ref>{{Cite|Oh! Talk about great timing! Can you go deliver ice to Furosa again?|Anche|BotW}}</ref> Anche charges Link 50 [[Rupee]]s for the ice and explains that Furosa will reimburse him.<ref>{{Cite|Of course, before you carry the ice, I'll have to ask you to pay the {{Color|BotW Red|50 rupees}} for the ice in advance, though...|Anche|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Once you've delivered it, Furosa should be able to reimburse you for the cost of the ice.|Anche|BotW}}</ref> Link is timed while delivering the ice and if he delivers it in a short amount of time, such as under 2 minutes, Furosa will be shocked with his time and reward him with a [[Gold Rupee]].<ref>{{Cite|You've got to be kidding me. Ice delivered in {{Color|BotW Red|XX:XX.XX}}?|Furosa|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|That is WAY beyond my expectations! You're like a savant at ice running.|Furosa|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Let me reimburse you for the price of the ice...and I'd better dig deep for something extra to reward a run like that!|Furosa|BotW}}</ref> Furosa also states that Anche must be happy and asks him if he wants to deliver more ice.<ref>{{Cite|Anche must be happy...because the ice sure seems happy!|Furosa|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|If you could, I would love it if you'd make another run... Think you could find it in your heart to go again?|Furosa|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|You need lots of ice to serve good cocktails, you know?|Furosa|BotW}}</ref>\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Nomenclature}}\n\n{{Ref}}\n\n{{Categories\n |Gerudo\n |characters= BotW\n}}"}}}]}}}}
