Cottla and her sister Koko wake up at 5 o'clock with Cottla claiming her mother is hiding.<ref>{{Cite|Mommy's hiding! Hmmm, maybe she's over there!|Cottla|BotW}}</ref> Link can ask her if she'd like to play, but she will refuse at this time, claiming that she and her mother are already in the middle of a game.<ref>{{Cite|NO!! I'm playing with Mommy right now. You'll just have to wait your turn!|Cottla|BotW}}</ref> She will then head up to the [[Ta'loh Naeg Shrine]] to search for the \"hiding\" woman.<ref>{{Cite|Mommy's hiding...but I'll find her!|Cottla|BotW}}</ref> By 8 o'clock, Cottla gives up and goes to meet with the rest of her family.<ref>{{Cite|Daddy! Big Sis! I'm waaaiiiting!|Cottla|BotW}}</ref> \n\nAt 8:30 in the morning, Cottla will sit at the base of a [[Tree]] near a fork in the road, wondering if her other family members will come by.<ref>{{Cite|I wonder...if they'll be here soon...|Cottla|BotW}}</ref> At around 9 o'clock, Koko will join her. After Link speaks with Impa for the first time, Dorian will also be quick to join them. When 11 o'clock rolls by, the girls will get up and go their separate ways, running through the Village as Dorian returns to work. If [[Link]] speaks to her while she is scampering about, she'll declare that she's bored.<ref>{{Cite|When's food?! I'm BORED!|Cottla|BotW}}</ref> Should he immediately say goodbye, she will be disappointed.<ref>{{Cite|But...I'm bored...|Cottla|BotW}}</ref>\n\nIf Link asks her if she'd like to play with him, she will be excited at once, causing her to ask what he would like to play.<ref>{{Cite|YAAAY! What'll it be? What'll it be?|Cottla|BotW}}</ref> For games, Link can choose between Tag or Hide-and-seek. Choosing Tag excites Cottla further and she begins to run in place.<ref>{{Cite|YAAAY! I'll start running!|Cottla|BotW}}</ref> Choosing Hide-and-seek makes Cottla declare that she will hide while Link seeks her.<ref>{{Cite|I'll go hiiiide!|Cottla|BotW}}</ref> She is ready to have fun, but lets Link know that they will have to stop the game at dinnertime.<ref>{{Cite|But I've gotta go home to Sis when it's dinnertime, OK?|Cottla|BotW}}</ref> Selecting a game and agreeing to play begins the \"[[Playtime with Cottla]]\" [[Side Quest]]. Once the Side Quest is over, Cottla will still want to play if Link asks her and they can do it as many times as he likes, as long as it is during the day.\n\nAt around 4:30, Cottla will head down to the kitchen area where Koko has been [[Cooking]], sitting at one of the tables.<ref>{{Cite|So hungry!|Cottla|BotW}}</ref> She is incredibly hungry by now and impatiently waits for the food to be ready.<ref>{{Cite|Dinner! DINNER!|Cottla|BotW}}</ref> Link can still ask if she would like to play, but she is too focused on dinner to want to.<ref>{{Cite|NO!! I've gotta chow down with Big Sis now! You're just gonna have to wait!|Cottla|BotW}}</ref> 7 o'clock is when both Cottla and her sister Koko head home for the night.<ref>{{Cite|I'm going home...|Cottla|BotW}}</ref> When asleep, Cottla is dreaming about her parents.<ref>{{Cite|Mommy...|Cottla|BotW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|Daddy...|Cottla|BotW}}</ref> \n\nEven in the [[Rain]], Cottla can be found running about.<ref>{{Cite|I looove the rain!
